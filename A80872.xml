            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is the unſpeakable unhappineſs of all the Children of Men whilſt in a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they are favoured only with Temporal Bleſſings; and as an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their miſery, their Spirit ſtandeth prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and chiefly towards thoſe Earthly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are minding Earthly things, <hi>Phil. 3.19.</hi> their higheſt purſuits are after theſe, they eſtimate and value themſelves according to the meaſures of theſe which they have enrichment with, they are carnally minded, which is death, <hi>Rom. 8.6.</hi> They are dead to the things of God, which are of higheſt concernment to their Souls.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, all, even the loweſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are Priviledged not only with ſome, but with all Spiritual Bleſſings, <hi>Eph. 1.3.</hi> So as they are rightly denominated Spiritual Men, <hi>1 Cor. 2.15. Gal. 6.1.</hi> They are ſo in their principles. Indeed, by a non-improvement thereof,
<pb facs="tcp:133178:3"/>although the ſtanding frame of their heart is to Spiritual things, yet many, if not moſt, come exceedingly ſhort in point of practice, that it may be ſaid to them, as <hi>1 Cor. 3.1. Are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</hi> They are apt to Diviſions, and ſo are Carnal. <hi>v. 3.</hi> To build hay and ſtubble, (that which will not abide the fire, and is of little value) upon the true foundation, and ſo are carnal; too worldly, and do not exerciſe Grace in its due height upon all occaſions, and ſo are carnal.</p>
            <p>To reduce or advance Chriſtians unto their proper frame and temper of ſpirituality, this eminent and judicious Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt Mr. <hi>John Cromwell</hi> (the Author of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Sermons) hath diſcovered what Spiritual Bleſſings they are intruſted with.</p>
            <p>It is a matter of lamentation that ſuch a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer in the Lords Vineyard ſhould ſo early be tranſplanted to eternity, and that when ſo many other eminent Miniſters have lately been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from that place by death.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sermons were taken from his mouth by the Pen of a ready Writer; they would have come forth in a better dreſs, and with much more advantage if they had been poliſhed with his own hand; but as they are here preſented to view they may be exceedingly uſeful to thoſe whoſe Citizenſhip is in heaven, their affections in Heaven, their converſations in Heaven whilſt they are on Earth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:133178:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Indeed they evidence that he himſelf had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at a more than ordinary ſtrain of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality, which is a great excellency, becauſe Spiritual Bleſſings are moſt excellent, the beſt of Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>They have the beſt Original, they have the beſt Father, even him who is the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph. 1.3.</hi> They come from the beſt place, not from Earth, but Heaven [in heavenly places] from Gods Throne, thence he giveth forth all theſe of the beſt nature; it may be rendred [in heavenlies] <hi>i.e.</hi> Not only in heavenly places, but in heavenly things.</p>
            <p>Yea Spiritual Bleſſings have a tendency to the imbelliſhing, and adorning the nobleſt part, the immortal Soul; a man may be enriched with temporal Bleſſings, and his Spirit may be the worſe for theſe, but ever is the better for theſe Spiritual Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>They furniſh for the beſt operations and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; Earthly things may indiſpoſe for the higheſt Services and moſt glorious imployments, they may be clogs and heavy weights preſſing down, which muſt be caſt off in running the Chriſtian race, <hi>Heb. 12.1.</hi> But Spiritual Bleſſings capacitate for the choiceſt actings; they give the beſt diſcerning of matters which are of higheſt concernment and greateſt moment, <hi>1 Cor. 2.15.</hi> The Spiritual man judgeth all things, <hi>i. e.</hi> Spiritual men are enabled to paſs
<pb facs="tcp:133178:4"/>right Judgment upon Divine matters, and what concern themſelves, their own conditions, their own Salvation and what is conducible to it, and this far beyond what a natural man, one in a natural condition by the greateſt parts can attain unto.</p>
            <p>They capacitate to be Spiritually helpful unto others who are fallen by temptation, <hi>Gal. 6.1.</hi> If a man be overtaken with a fault, ye which are Spiritual reſtore ſuch a one, put him in joint again. They help to deſcry the ways and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Satan in tempting, and of Jeſus Chriſt in ſuccouring. They qualify to encounter and conflict with Spiritual enemies, and reſiſt Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual evils, which there is the greateſt difficulty in the withſtanding of, <hi>Eph. 6.12.</hi> The grace of humility helpeth to expell Spiritual pride, and the grace of love helpeth againſt ſelf-love. Spiritual Bleſſings will enable to make improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all occurrences towards the higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, he that is carnal maketh an ill uſe of all that is before him, he turneth all to ſin, to himſelf, he ſetteth corruption or ſin on work by all Enjoyments, Riches, Pleaſures, Relations, yea even by the gracious actings of the Saints, but he that is Spiritual maketh uſe not only of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, but even of the worſt befalments, as Tryals and afflictions, towards Raiſing, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and mounting, his Soul more towards God, he by a Spiritual Chymiſtry can extract good
<pb facs="tcp:133178:4"/>out of the worſt that betideth him. Spiritual Bleſſings will advance to a chooſing the higheſt and beſt ends; When others have inferiour, baſe and low ends of their actings, ſuch as are privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged with theſe will make God their ultimate and chiefeſt end, they have a frame for doing all to the glory of God, <hi>1 Cor. 10.31.</hi> Yea Spiritual Bleſſings are diſcriminating, differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Chriſtians from others, <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.</hi> v. <hi>14, 15.</hi> And ſo they are evidences of the ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and love of God, v. <hi>10.</hi> Whereas a man may have other enjoyments and yet be an object of the higheſt wrath and indignation of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
            <p>And once more, Spiritual bleſſings they are eternal Bleſſings; other things are of no conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, a man may ſoon be ſtripped and diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of them, but Spiritual Bleſſings will never be loſt, they will abide for ever, all which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently argue that they have a tranſcendent excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency far above other things.</p>
            <p>And all theſe are diſpenſed out in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph. 1.3.</hi> They may have a large meaſure of temporal things, and yet be out of Chriſt, but theſe are all vouchſafed in him, they are the fruit of his purchaſe, obtained by a union with him. He is the great repoſitory, the ſtore houſe where all Spiritual Bleſſings are treaſured up, <hi>Col. 1.19.</hi> It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell, that we might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb facs="tcp:133178:5"/>to him for all ſupplies evermore. Thoſe in a Chriſtleſs condition are deſtitute thereof, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their attainments be, and the great reaſon why Chriſtians are no more repleniſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, is becauſe they repair no more to him, that they may have ſupplies.</p>
            <p>None are to content themſelves with any lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer degree; but yet thoſe who have the ſmalleſt portion may be ſupported and comforted by the ſecond Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> That where there is grace but as a grain of Corn, the loweſt meaſure, yet the Lord hath a high eſtimation of it. And that all grace may be multiplied ſhall be the Prayer of him who is</p>

               <p>IT is the Intereſt of Chriſtians, in all the Circumſtances of their lives, to enquire after and make ſure of ſomething that is Spiritual. There is nothing that <hi>Satan</hi> deſigns more, then either to obſtruct their Right, or to Cloud their Right, to thoſe Bleſſings that are Spiritual and Eternal. Of all lives, a Life of Faith, converſant in things that are not ſeen, is the moſt hateful Life to the Devil, and the moſt unknown Life to the World, but the propereſt Life that a Chriſtian can live, in and under all the variety of his Condition here below; Chriſtians, you underſtand the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:133178:6"/>deſign of the Devil, and of the World, upon your temporals; how far it will pleaſe the Majeſty of Heaven, to give them leave to proſper in their deſign, I cannot determine, but that you and I may have ſomething to bear up our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits withal, whatever liberty or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they have from Heaven: That we may have ſomething to rejoyce our hearts withal; I have therefore propoſed to ſpeak ſomething to you from theſe words, which are a diſcovery of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen bleſſedneſs of a Chriſtian, in and under all the Circumſtances of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this Life.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould ask me what a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is, I would tell you as to his ſtate that he is <hi>a Spiritual man, Bleſſed with all Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Bleſſings, by the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt, in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and this is a Chriſtians ſtate: And ſurely the Apoſtle ſaw great reaſon to rejoyce, upon his view and apprehenſion of this; no ſooner did it begin to bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his Spirit, but ſo ſoon as ever it began to work in his heart, he breaks forth into Bleſſings of the author of it, <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath Bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Heavenly places in Chriſt.</hi>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:133178:6"/>
               <p>I ſhall only take notice of theſe 3 things, that are principally compriſed in the words.</p>

The Second thing that I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve out of the words is this: <hi>The ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and certainty of theſe Bleſſings,</hi> It is a work not to be done, but a work that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done; Bleſſings not lodged in deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearts, but in faithful hands; Bleſſings not betruſted with one that may miſcarry, but with one whom God knows cannot miſcarry; and therefore you may obſerve the Apoſtle here tells us, that the buſineſs is done, that the Bleſſings are given, Bleſſed be the God and Father, &amp;c. <hi>Who hath Bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Natural Bleſſings, the Bleſſings of our Creation were very great Bleſſings, our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bleſſings were very great Bleſſings, but not to be compared to theſe Spiritual Bleſſings, neither were they ſo enſured.</p>
               <p>For God Bleſſed all the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> with all Natural Bleſſings in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:133178:7"/>
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> but you know what became of them, but the Bleſſings of the New Covenant, they are Spiritual Bleſſings, no more to be truſted in the hands of any, but of one whom God dare venture to truſt withal; therefore ſays he, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath Bleſſed us with all Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bleſſings in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing that is remarkable in the words is this, <hi>the Author, or the great Bleſſer:</hi> Whoſe Glory the Apoſtle here doth exemplify and illuſtrate by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that ſeems to be repreſented to us under this double conſideration.</p>
               <p>Firſt he is <hi>the God of the Lord Jeſus, that died that he might purchaſe theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings for us.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>He is not only the God of the purchaſing Jeſus, but he is alſo his Father.</hi> If there be any ſecurity or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ariſing to Chriſtians, that God is Chriſts God, the advantage lies here, and is improvable in this Caſe. <hi>It is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that Bleſſeth us.</hi> If there be any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that reſults from the Relation that God has to Chriſt as a Father, that was never diſhonoured by him, a Father
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:133178:7"/>that was never diſpleaſed nor grieved with him, this redounds alſo unto Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to illuſtrate the Glory of their Bleſſedneſs, and to evidence the truth and certainty of their Eternal enjoyment of him; he is not a God that is a God of diſtance in concern, but he is a God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and not only concerned in the Relations of the Goſpel to us, but in all the Relations of the Goſpel unto Chriſt, who is related unto Chriſtians: So that a Chriſtian may ſay, the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>my Lord, of my head,</hi> has Bleſſed me with all Spiritual Bleſſings, <hi>in my Lord, my head,</hi> The God and Father of <hi>my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> has Bleſſed me with all Spiritual Bleſſings <hi>in my Huſband;</hi> The God and Father of <hi>my Mediatour</hi> has Bleſſed me with all Spiritual Bleſſings <hi>in my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour:</hi> So that, my Friends, you may look upon God not Bleſſing us as a God at large, but as a God engaged in Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſt. It is the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The ſame God that Bleſſed <hi>Adam;</hi> but now God appearing as a Bleſſing God in another Relation, and clothing himſelf with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glory; he Bleſſed him as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ay but he is now Bleſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as the God and Father of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:133178:8"/>And thus now I have opened the words to you.</p>
               <p>The Propoſitions that lie in the words are many, but intending this only as an occaſional diſcourſe, I ſhall therefore confine my ſelf to theſe two or three.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Grace could never content its ſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite grace could never bound its ſelf, all the bleſſings a ſinner ſtands in need of to make him a Saint, and all the Bleſſings a Saint ſtands in need of, to make him an Eternally Bleſſed Saint, theſe are the Bleſſings, that are the proper por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians. Let God diſpoſe of temporal Bleſſings at his pleaſure; theſe are below the grace of God, to make them the Childrens Portion. Let God give them to whom he pleaſe: So he do but reſerve to you theſe that are of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Nature, and theſe you ſee are Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings without Limitation, all Spiritual Bleſſings are beſtowed upon Chriſtians. Surely then Chriſtians may cry out, and have reaſon to cry out. O! What a God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:133178:8"/>have we? O what a Father have we? O! What Fatherly grace works in the heart of our Father, who has Bleſſed us not with ſome <hi>few,</hi> but with <hi>all,</hi> Spiritual Bleſſings, there is not a Bleſſing wanting, no one ſhall want his Bleſſing.</p>

               <p>Theſe are the three principal Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that lie in the words. It is only the firſt of theſe that I deſign (if the Lord pleaſe) to make the Subject of this days diſcourſes, and my deſign in diſcourſing upon it is this, that I may (if it be the Lords pleaſure) raiſe up your minds, and fix your Hearts, upon what is Spiritual and unſeen. God never eſtimated a Chriſtian by any viſible Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings he gave him here, they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the beſt Chriſtians, that are the richeſt or honourableſt, but he eſtimates a Chriſtian in the ballance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:133178:9"/>he is weighed with all his Spiritual Bleſſings; if thou beeſt never ſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht, if thou beeſt never ſo Bleſſed with temporals, yet let me tell thee, thou maiſt be found light, and thou maiſt be found too light too, when God comes to weigh thee. But God eſtimates and weighs a Chriſtian by what is Spiritual in him, by what is unſeen in him.</p>
               <p>And therefore Chriſtians, I pray at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto the opening of this inquiry.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the opening of this, I ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, the bounds of the diſcoveries, that the Holy-Ghoſt has made in this Chapter; here are Spiritual Bleſſings enough, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in this Chapter, to take up our minds, and to raiſe our hearts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall confine my diſcourſe to what I find herein diſcovered.</p>
               <p>But before I enter into the particular reſolve of it, I ſhall only premiſe this in general, that whatſoever I mention, you muſt take it as the Lord intends it, that is, with all the advantages that are here diſcovered; <hi>who hath Bleſſed us with all;</hi> here is an <hi>Allneſs,</hi> an Univerſality upon every Spiritual Bleſſing.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> I ſhall give you account of this in theſe ſix or ſeven Obſervations ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſo many ſeveral paſſages in this Chapter. And</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, <hi>by Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings I underſtand Eternal Election.</hi> And Eternal Election is called Spiritual, not becauſe the Spirit is principal in giving being to it, but becauſe the Spirit is principal in the manage of it, and in the application of it; it is the Father that chooſes us, but it is the Spirit that mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the choice. It is the Father that elects us, before the Foundations of the World, ay but it is the Spirit that is principally concerned in the inſuring, or in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of this Election, upon this or that Elect Perſon: This Bleſſing the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, in verſe 4. <hi>According ſays he, as he hath choſen us in him, before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pray do but obſerve, it is an Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto grace, it is a choice, that God has made from all Eternity, A choice of grace, and that unto the practice of grace. Chriſtians do but conſider with your ſelves, you are not only choſen to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:133178:10"/>have your hearts ſanctified, but to have all the graces of the Spirit in your hearts exerciſed. It is not only a perſonal, but a practical holineſs, that the grace of God did eye in the Eternal choice that he made of you; you (it may be) are under diverſe Temptations, under diverſe fears of heart, ſometimes you can ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in your hearts, and you bleſs God for that, but you look into your lives, and there is but little grace there, and you look into you duties, and it may be there is as little diſcoverable there; but here is the Bleſſedneſs that I have ſtated, ye are choſen that your Converſations ſhould be filled with all practical Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Godlineſs. The Apoſtle clears it in that paſſage, in the 4 verſe. <hi>That we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him.</hi> Taking us in our whole complex conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, taking Perſon and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God hath choſen us, that we ſhould pray without blame, that we ſhould praiſe him without blame, that we ſhould love him without blame, and that we ſhould be without blame before him, in our whole Converſation, and I pray do but obſerve, how our Lord Jeſus is concerned in the manage of this, in the fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this ſame Epiſtle, where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (or rather the Holy-Ghoſt by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:133178:11"/>Apoſtle) propoſeth the Spiritual Husband as a pattern unto Chriſtian temporal Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, ſays he, <hi>Husbands love your Wives, even as Chriſt loved the Church, verſe</hi> 25. But wherein doth the excellency or emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of Chriſts Love, appear unto his Spouſe? You ſhall find it in the 27. verſe, <hi>He loved them, and he goes on to Love, and Love and Love;</hi> he Loves them, and he dyes for them, he Loves them, &amp; he interceeds for them; he Loves them, and he rules them, he Loves them, and he enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens them, he Loves them, and he ſtrengthens them; ay but what is the great manifeſtation of his Love? Why, ſaies he, <hi>that he might preſent it a Glorious Church to himſelf, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> God choſe us that we might be holy, and without blame, and Jeſus Chriſt has ſuch a Love to us, even as the Father has, that we ſhould be holy and without blame; and, my Friends, the Spirit is all one with the Father, and the Son: Does the Father chooſe us, and does the Son give himſelf for us, that we might be ſo, then comes the Spirit, and reſolves that he will make us ſo; and therefore you ſhall find the Apoſtle, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> giving us an account of the fruits of the Spirit, in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:133178:11"/>the fifth Chapter at the 18 verſe, <hi>if ſo be ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law.</hi> And then as to the energy, the workings of the Spirit, why, ſays he, in the 17 verſe, <hi>The Spirit luſteth againſt the fleſh.</hi> The fleſhly part in us is an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving part, that is againſt living out of our ſelves upon Chriſt, ay but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that works contrary, unto theſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral luſtings, and natural workings of the fleſh, for ſays the Apoſtle, v. 22. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith,</hi> &amp;c. By comparing theſe paſſages together, you may raiſe this obſervation, that even as the Father and the Son are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our practical as well as perſonal holineſs, ſo alſo is the Spirit, he luſts, and he works, and he ſtrives, and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves luſting and ſtriving, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the fleſh, until he have brought forth theſe fruits of Love, Joy, Peace, and Long-ſuffering, and Gentleneſs, and goodneſs, and Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that this is the firſt particular, God has choſen us unto perſonal and practical holineſs, and if you do obſerve it, this Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is alſo enſured unto us in Chriſt, with all the contents of it, and with all the proper effects of it. May a Poor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:133178:12"/>Creature ſay; But how ſhall I come to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this? And what ſecurity can I have of it? Why, ſays he, <hi>according as he hath choſen us in him;</hi> he hath Bleſſed us in him, according as he hath choſen us in him; and now, ſays he, he hath Bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in him. But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second Bleſſing that the Apoſtle takes notice of is <hi>the great Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Adoption,</hi> which doth not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a Relation to God, but alſo a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table frame, and a ſutable becoming ſenſe of the Relation, a ſenſe of it, and a frame comporting and complying with it: This you have an account of, in the 5 <hi>verſe, Having predeſtinated us to the Adoption of Children to himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. I pray do but obſerve, what the Apoſtle here doth diſcover, concerning the Nature of this, it is the Adoption of Children to himſelf. The God and Father of our Lord Jeſus hath enſured our Adoption, with all the Priviledges, with all the Bleſſed conſequents of it unto us, in Chriſt Jeſus: 'Tis the God and Father of Chriſt Jeſus, and he that is ſo, is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, a God adopting us unto himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt. This you ſhall find the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture frequently making mention of; ſays the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans, We have not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:133178:12"/>received the Spirit of Bondage, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption,</hi> the Spirit of Sons, and what is the proper work of the Spirit of Adoption? You ſhall find what it is, Rom. 8.15. <hi>Ye have not received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> Says the Apoſtle, ye are Sons, ay but the Sonſhip is manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit; ye are not only Sons, but the Spirit witneſſeth with your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that ye are ſo, and that is his proper work; and what is the iſſue of that? Why, ſays he, <hi>ye cry, Abba Father;</hi> you may go to God in your diſtreſſes, and you may go to God under your Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and you may go to God, as the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt, under all your ſtraits and troubles, and under all your Spiritual wants, and you may ſay unto him, Father hear, and Father help. Says the Apoſtle, <hi>ye have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of Bondage again to fear.</hi> Indeed under the Law, when they were under the Power of the Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, they ſtood at a diſtance from God, they were under fear; but now, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>ye have not received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby ye
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:133178:13"/>cry, Abba Father.</hi> It is as natural a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to a Child of God, and it is as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Language to gracious hearts to cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> as it is for a Child to cry to his Father, Father or Mother; <hi>ye have received the Spirit of Adoption</hi> ſays he; and the ſame thing you have the Apoſtle giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us an account of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law.</hi> Why, what then? <hi>That we might receive the Adoption of Sons, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are Sons, ſays he, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father.</hi> I would only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this to you, which it may be is not ſo obvious to every apprehenſion: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare but theſe two Scriptures together, and you ſhall find that in the one he is the Spirit of Adoption, as he is the Fathers Spirit, and in the other he is the Spirit of Adoption, as he is the Spirit of the Son, for ſaith he, <hi>he has ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father.</hi> The Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, the ſame Spirit that influenced the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and in which Jeſus Chriſt always prayed to God as a Father, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways walked with God, under all varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of providences, as with a Father, the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:133178:13"/>ſame Spirit he hath ſent forth, and this ſame Spirit that cryed <hi>Abba</hi> Father in Chriſt, crys <hi>Abba</hi> Father alſo in Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Spiritual Bleſſing that the Apoſtle makes mention of in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, <hi>an univerſal acceptance of Chriſtians in all caſes, notwithſtanding all diſobligements;</hi> one would wonder that a child ſhould ſin, and though the ſin be rejected, yet the child ſtand ſtill in a ſtate of acceptation, though the Father ſcourge the Child, yet he doth not unchild the Child. This you have an account of, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> I pray do but obſerve it: There is nothing that a Chriſtian can propoſe to himſelf, there is no caſe that the Devil, and the world can expoſe a Chriſtian to but the Chriſtian is ſtill accepted in Chriſt Jeſus, and that notwithſtanding all his fears, and under all his Jealouſies, and in the face of all his conſcience accuſations, and his own ſelf-condemnations, yet the Child is accepted, the Chriſtian is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who hath made us (ſays he) accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beloved; my friends this is a great Spiritual Bleſſing indeed. There are many that have their hearts greatly concerned, and their Spirit wonderfully
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:133178:14"/>diſquieted about their acceptance; O that I did but know that God did accept me! O that I did but know that I were accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt Jeſus! Why truly, Chriſtians, this is one of your proper Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, a Bleſſing which the Spirit is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally concerned in the manage of; <hi>He hath made us,</hi> ſays he, <hi>accepted.</hi> Though there be never ſo little grace in the heart, yet it is accepted; two Mites that the poor Widow caſt into the Treaſury, you know what acceptation it found with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Verily,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I ſay unto you ſhe hath caſt in more then they all they of their abundance have caſt into the Treaſury, but ſhe hath caſt in even all that ſhe hath.</hi> O Sirs, if you have never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grace, caſt it into your prayers, and caſt it into your Sermons, and caſt it into &amp; imploy it in your converſations: Verily will Chriſt ſay, this man hath done more then ſuch a one, he had but a few gifts and he imployed them all, he hath but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grace, and behold I ſee this little i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:133178:14"/>many of your underſtandings, with a great deal of Gopel light, but alas there is but little of it ſeen in your lives and in your hearts; it may be you are filled with grace, ay but there is but little of this grace to be ſeen in your duties: There comes a poor humble Chriſtian with his Mite to pray, and with his Mite to hear, and behold he caſts all in, and the Lord ſees that all the grace that is in his heart he puts forth in every duty, and he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth in every Ordinance; Verily, ſays Chriſt, I ſay unto you, ſhe hath done more then they all: Therefore, my friends, let me tell you, the God &amp; Father of Jeſus Chriſt (for ſtill we muſt conſider him under that notion) I ſay the God and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Jeſus Chriſt hath made us accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beloved, if there be any thing that is unacceptable in thee, if there be nothing to be ſeen in thee but what is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging, yet the Lord hath made you that are Chriſtians <hi>accepted in the beloved,</hi> not accepted in your own graces, not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your ſelves, not accepted for this or that or the other, but all your acceptance is ſtill in Chriſt, <hi>who hath made us accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beloved.</hi> Now my friends, that the Spirit of the Lord doth manage this, this alſo is evident, if we do but conſider
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:133178:15"/>what it is wherein our perſonal accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies; doth it lie in our gracious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications which we receive from Jeſus Chriſt? why thoſe we receive by the Spirit; doth the Lord accept us upon the account of the exerciſe of any grace in any duty? why truly all this is alſo from the ſame Spirit. There are, ſays the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, diverſity of gifts, and diverſity of operations, ay but ſtill there is one and the ſame Spirit: It is the ſame Spirit. It may be there is a great deal of humility in thy duty, or in thy heart, and thou art accepted in Jeſus Chriſt, but how cameſt thou by this humility? how cameſt thou by this meekneſs? why the Spirit of the Lord hath reſted upon thee in the form of a Dove, as the Spirit of meekneſs, and as the Spirit of lowlineſs, and as the Spirit of ſelfdenial: The ſame ſpirit that reſted upon Chriſt, the ſame Spirit alſo hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted upon thee: So that you ſee alſo in this third great Spiritual Bleſſing how far the Spirit, and how much the ſon is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beloved: O my friends, that there ſhould be ſuch a myſtery as this, and all the Priviledges &amp; advantages of it ſhould be enſured to all the ſeed in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:133178:15"/>Jeſus Chriſt! It is God that makes us, and not we our ſelves, accepted in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, <hi>wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved.</hi> I will break off with this one ſhort Reflexion, upon what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered.</p>

                  </label> You ſee my Brethren, in the worſt of times here is the Beſt of Bleſſings enſured, in the worſt of circumſtances here are the gloriouſeſt priviledges in ſafe hands for you; what can you deſire more then all Spiritual Bleſſings of the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt? what can You deſire more? It may be he hath Bleſſed ſuch a one with temporal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſuch a one he hath Bleſſed with wiſdom, and ſuch a one with ſtrength, and ſuch a one with riches and honour, and the like, ay but my Friends, he hath not bleſſed every one with all <hi>Temporal Bleſſings;</hi> ſays <hi>Eſau</hi> to his Brother <hi>Jacob, I have enough my Brother:</hi> ay but it was only <hi>Jacob,</hi> It was only <hi>Iſrael</hi> that had prevailed with God, that could ſay, <hi>I have all My Brother;</hi> I have all things, what did he mean? I have God for my exceeding great reward, and I have all things in the Covenant; I have all things in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, I have all things in the promiſe. Now Chriſtians, take an occaſion from hence to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:133178:16"/>make an eſtimate of the vaſt difference that there is between a Chriſtian indeed, and one that is but a Chriſtian in ſhew, one that lay under great worldly diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; and yet a Chriſtian, and one that lay under, or that is advanced up to the top of all ſecular advantages and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, and preferments, even by God himſelf. Would you know Chriſtians where the difference lay? why it lies here; the one hath all, and that for ever, and the other hath but what he hath in part, and that not ſecured neither; worldlings they have not their greatneſs in Chriſt, they have not their honour given them in Chriſt, they have not their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given them in Chriſt; No, no, my Friends, but now the meaneſt Chriſtian, hath not only all things, but all things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him in Chriſt; he is not only a better man then the greateſt worldling is, upon the account of the extent; but alſo upon the account of the Method and Manner wherein all is give him, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to him. There is not a perſon in the world that can ſay, or ever could ſay, <hi>I have all things; Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in all his glory could not ſay, <hi>I have all things:</hi> But a poor Chriſtian, a poor perſecuted <hi>Paul</hi> could cry out, <hi>I have all things,</hi> and I
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:133178:16"/>can do all things; even then when he had nothing at all in compariſon, ſays he, <hi>I have all things and abound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Chriſtians, I pray you rejoyce in your condition. And I beſeech you ſinners, become all Chriſtians; for whileſt you are as you are, you have but ſome things, and what you have is all out of Chriſt; but do but become Chriſtians, do but give up your heads and hearts to the Lord, and then you may ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and father of the Lord Jeſus, who hath bleſſed me with all Spiritual bleſſings in Chriſt.</hi>

                  </label> In the opening of this I premiſed this in general, that there is an univerſality annexed to every particular Spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: It is not only annexed to the ſorts of bleſſings, but to every bleſſing of every ſort. I could mention but Three.</p>
               <p>The laſt that we mentioned was this, an univerſal acceptation with the Father in all caſes notwithſtanding all diſobligements. O, ſays a Poor Chriſtian, if I were but ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that God would accept me, with all the diſobliging notwithſtandings of my heart and life, and of my Duties, how happy ſhould I be! and indeed ſo thou wouldſt be, if God would accept thee notwithſtanding all thy unprofitableneſs, notwithſtanding all the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:133178:18"/>treachery of thy heart, notwithſtanding all thy oppoſition to, &amp; grievings of his bleſſed Spirit, notwithſtanding all the diſhonour that thou haſt done unto himſelf, his Son, and his bleſſed Spirit, if the Lord would but accept thee, thou wouldſt be happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; why Chriſtian, here is thy ſpiritual bleſſedneſs, at the 6th verſe <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved</hi> Lord (may every poor Chriſtian ſay) what am I? I accepted in the beloved? I accepted in the beloved Son? In the beloved Saviour? In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved high Prieſt? Lord what manner of grace is this! This is not the kindneſs of man: Chriſtians let me tell you, it is Gods work of grace to make you accepted, and it is your Priviledge in grace to be accepted; he hath made us to be accepted in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, if there be any thing of unworthineſs in you there is the blood of the beloved to ballance it, if there be any thing of empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Barrenneſs, there is the fulneſs of the beloved to counterpoiſe that, if there be any unworthineſs diſcovered in any of your Relations or carriages to God, there is the full import of all his Relations to God to make all even. Though you do not always carry it as Children, yet this Son of God always did, and though you do not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:133178:18"/>always live like Servants, yet this Son of God did to a point, and though you do not always carry it like friends to God, and like the people of God, yet behold the head of all, he carries it like ſuch a one. God may have abundance ('tis like) to charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; But this is not your buſineſs whether you have much grace or little grace or whether you exerciſe more or leſs. The acceptance muſt be in the beloved. Thus far we have proceeded.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another ſpiritual bleſſing wherewith God hath bleſſed Chriſtians in Chriſt, is <hi>the revelation of his ſecrets.</hi> God may reveal the ſecrets of his Providence to others (as I might inſtance in diverſe) but his ſaving ſecrets thoſe are made manifeſt only in Chriſt Jeſus to Chriſtians; many have a dogmatical, diſcurſive knowledge which God hath given them, but here is the eclipſe of the glory of all their knowledge. It is not given them in Chriſt, here is a poor Chriſtian that is but broken, and now and then hath a little glimmerings of the light of God, and a little inſight into the ſecrets of his grace: Now my friends, this little light, and theſe little glimmerings that he hath into the myſteries of the will of God, theſe are all given him in Chriſt Jeſus, he ſees ſin in Chriſt, and he ſees the beauty of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:133178:19"/>grace and holineſs in Chriſt. The revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Goſpel will about ſin and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: The beauty of holineſs and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin is made manifeſt to him in Chriſt Jeſus. I pray do but obſerve how the Apoſtle expreſſes himſelf in the 9th verſe, <hi>Having made known unto us the myſtery of his will, according to his good pleaſure which he purpoſed in himſelf.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in the 18th verſe makes it his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſupplication to God for theſe Chriſtian <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that, ſays he, <hi>the Eyes of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings being inlightned, that ye may know what is the hope of your calling.</hi> There is the myſtery of his will manifeſted in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the hope of your calling. You are called off from ſin, there is hope in that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and you are called unto duty, and there is hope in that calling, and you are called off from all your Relations unto the world, as you ſtand in the World, and there is hope in that calling; now, ſays the Apoſtle, I pray for you that your eyes may be inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that you may know what is the hope of your calling; and my Friends, you will find that the Apoſtle doth wrap up them together with himſelf in the 9th verſe, and tells us there that he hath made known unto us the myſtery of his will, and yet for all that he prays that the eyes of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:133178:19"/>may be inlightned that they may know what is the hope of their calling, and what is the Riches of his inheritance in the Saints. Now I ſhall ſhew you that all this is vouchſafed to Chriſtians in Chriſt; you ſhall find the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3. telling us, <hi>that in him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge.</hi> Why what wiſdom and knowledge? Why that wiſdom, and that knowledge, that the eternal grace of God did deſign for Chriſtians, ſo that we are bleſſed with this wiſdom and knowledg in Chriſt. Look into your underſtandings and hearts, alas there is but little there, there is no treaſures there, but look into the Lord Jeſus, and there are all treaſures, even for fooliſh Chriſtians, hid and lodged there; <hi>in him is hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge.</hi> And that the Spirit of the Lord is alike concerned in this you ſhall obſerve if you do but conſult the Apoſtles experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Where he ſpeaks of things that eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor ever entered into the heart of man to conceive:</hi> But ſays he at the 10th verſe, <hi>God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them unto us by his Spirit.</hi> The reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſecrets of the heart of God is made manifeſt, or is made known unto Chriſtians by the Spirit of God. The Apoſtle proſecutes &amp; illuſtrates this myſtery by that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:133178:20"/>which is commonly obſerv'd amongſt men in v. 11. <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man ſave the Spirit of man which is in him?</hi> I do not know the grace that is in another mans heart, I do not know the ſecret purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and devices that are in your hearts, but your own Spirits are privy to them, even ſo ſays the Apoſtle the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God. Chriſtians, let me tell you, there is no ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecret in the heart of God the Father, there is no ſaving ſecret in the heart of Chriſt the Son, but the Lord hath bleſſed us with the knowledge and the Revelatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of that in Chriſt, for ſo the Apoſtle ſays in the 16 verſe. <hi>For who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may inſtruct him? but we have the mind of Chriſt</hi> Why Bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> how cameſt thou a perſecutor to know the mind of Chriſt? An injurious, and Blaſphemous wretch, how cameſt thou to be ſo intimate with that Jeſus whom thou perſecutedſt even unto death in his members? Why the Apoſtle tells you plainly, not by any natural advantage of learning, though he was a learned man, not by any advantage of his parts, though he was a man of clear natural underſtanding and apprehenſion, but, ſays he, we have the mind of Chriſt, and that by the Spirit of God, by the Spirit of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:133178:20"/>Jeſus Chriſt. So that you ſee here is another great Spiritual bleſſing, a revelation of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecrets.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another ſpiritual bleſſing that I ſhall ſuperadd is this, <hi>An <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal heading under Chriſt, or incorporation with Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> One would think it a wonder that ever ſuch a man, that was a limb of the Devil ſhould be made a member of the Body of Jeſus: A Notorious, Drunkard, a Notorious Blaſphemer, and a dreadful and implacable perſecutor of Chriſt and his ways, that ever ſuch a one ſhould be incorporated into and made a member of the Lord Jeſus is not this a ſpiritual bleſſing indeed? A bleſſing wherein the Spirit of God is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concerned; in the manage of this the Apoſtle takes notice of verſe 10. <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times he might gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in Heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</hi> And more plainly, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. Where he doth expreſly give us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and he tells us there that all the gifts that were given by Chriſt, were for the edifying of his body.</p>
               <p>Do but reflect upon a paſſage in the 2. Chapter, and there you ſhall ſee the ſtate of ſinners diſcovered to be as deſperate and as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:133178:21"/>vile as you can poſſibly ſuppoſe a ſinners ſtate to be, <hi>Dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience in whom the Prince of the power of the Air,</hi> the Spirit of Hell. <hi>did effectually work.</hi> Why Lord, ſhall ever thoſe be incorporated; ſhall ever thoſe be made members of ſo bleſſed a body as the Body of Jeſus? Nay this is not all, but, ſays he, <hi>Ye were Children of wrath.</hi> The Wrath of God ſmoaked againſt you, and all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and denunciations of Gods wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinners, belonged to you juſt as an inheritance belongs to a proper and right Heir; and that is not all neither, but verſe 12. <hi>Ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the commonwealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe, having no hope and without God in the World.</hi> Lord ſhall ſuch as theſe be made members of ſuch a bleſſed Body as the Body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is? Ay my Friends, here is the great bleſſing that God hath Bleſſed us with in Chriſt Jeſus, that notwithſtanding all this miſery, and notwithſtanding the deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that doth attend this miſerable Eſtate yet they are to be gathered together, and headed all under one Jeſus; I pray take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of one expreſſion in the concluſion of this Chapter, where he calls them all complexively conſidered his Body, and his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:133178:21"/>fulneſs, verſe 23. <hi>Which is his Body, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> Now my Friends, this is another Spiritual bleſſing that God hath bleſſed us withal, and that is heading of us under, or an incorporating us into the Body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that there can be no Bleſſing, no priviledge belong to the Head, but of neceſſity it falls naturally down upon the Body. So the head anointed the Garments ſhall be drenched, not only <hi>Aarons</hi> Beard, but the very Skirts of his Garments ſhall be drenched through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Is the Head advanced into glory. I tell you the Head in glory will never reſt till the members of his Body that are in a vile, deplorable, forlorn condition here, be made like unto him; <hi>Father,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I will,</hi> John 17.24. <hi>that thoſe alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me,</hi> &amp;c. One would wonder that God ſhould caſt off the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and implant Gentiles in their Room, and yet you ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. the Lord does thus, and the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with this, <hi>verſe</hi> 33. <hi>O the depth of the Riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God.</hi> That the natural branches ſhould be cut off, and Idolatours that had no promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Idolatours that had no Relations at all but only of Creatures to God, and who had done more to violate their Relations, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:133178:22"/>forfeit all the Priviledges of their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then the very Beaſts of the Field, and the moſt venomous, and poiſonous Toad ever did, yet ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>The natural branches were cut off that you might be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in.</hi> O the depth of the riches of Gods grace. Surely Chriſtians, this is a great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſing that the Lord is pleaſed to vouchſafe to us to head us under Chriſt. We are bleſſed with this in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another Spiritual Bleſſing is this; <hi>A reſerved Inheritance of all full, and Spiritual, and comprehenſive bleſſedneſſes.</hi> My friends here we have (to allude to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſs) it may be, ſome few Cottages or Tabernacles that are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory, as thoſe People had ſome moving reſting-places. Here is a little grace plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a little faith and a little love, and this grows up pretty likelily and pretty promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly, but what is this to the inheritance, where that which is in part ſhall be done way, where there is no ſuch thing as grace in part, no ſuch thing as love in part, no ſuch thing as joy in part, no ſuch thing as communion in part; for <hi>that which is in part ſhall be done away.</hi> I think the Apoſtle ſpeaks fully to our purpoſe where he tells us of an inheritance reſerved, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:133178:22"/>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> You ſee the Apoſtle mentions the ſame Relations that are here in the Text; why what is the matter, Bleſſed <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> Why ſays he, the matter is this; <hi>The God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for you, verſe</hi> 4. Why friends what is this inheritance? Why there I ſhall inherit the Covenant in its fulneſs; I ſhall not ſay that either I want any Law in my heart or in my Head, in my inward or in my outward man, I ſhall have no reaſon to complain that I want the leaſt bleſſing of the leaſt promiſe. Why Chriſtians, this is your inheritance, and are not here Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that are the proper matter of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance?

               <p n="7">7. But another ſpiritual bleſſing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are bleſſed in Chriſt Jeſus is this: <hi>The Seal and Earneſt of what is to come, and the very Spirit is made the very matter of this Bleſſing wherewith he hath bleſſed us in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I pray do but caſt your eyes upon <hi>verſe</hi> 13. <hi>In whom ye alſo truſted;</hi> ſtill he continues his diſcourſe, and fixes Chriſt at the bottom of all; <hi>in whom ye alſo truſted after that ye heard the word of truth, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of your Salvation, in whom alſo, after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy ſpirit of promiſe,</hi> verſe 14. <hi>which is the Earneſt of our Inheritance until the Redemption of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed poſſeſſion to the praiſe of his glory.</hi> Here is a comprehenſive ſpiritual bleſſing indeed, which is the Seal of the eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the Earneſt of it, as if the Lord ſhould ſay when he ſends forth his Spirit, go my holy Spirit, go and ſeize upon ſuch a heart, and ſeal up ſuch a Soul for the eternal Inheritance; and as if he ſhould ſay to his Son, Lo my Son, I have given my Spirit to ſuch a one whom thou haſt ſhed thy blood for, and lo I ſend him as the Earneſt of the Inheritance that thou haſt purchaſed, as the Earneſt of my eternal love to thee, as the Earneſt of my eternal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:133178:24"/>Communion with thee, as the earneſt of my anſwering of thy prayer, and the import of all thy blood: Lo I have ſent him, and lo, he is to them an Earneſt. Now Sirs, this is a great bleſſing, a very glorious bleſſing indeed, God might have deſigned, and kept the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in his own breaſt, or he might have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged it, &amp; yet have given us no earneſt or pledge of it; what needed all that between God and us? Chriſt might have taken his word, and we had good reaſon to reſt upon any report that the Lord Chriſt makes of his confidence in the Father, but the Lord Chriſt and the Father did concur together in this, that we ſhould have the Bleſſing, notwithſtanding all notwithſtandings, and that it ſhould be ſure to all the ſeed. Yet, for our further ſatisfaction, ſays the Lord, behold I give my promiſe, and I give the promiſed Spirit, and that Spirit ſhall be my Seal upon their hearts, and my ſeal upon their underſtandings; ſo that look into your hearts, and into your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and upon this inquiry, whoſe are you? Do but make a reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe Seal, whoſe Image, whoſe Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is this? You ſhall find that the Spirit of the Lord is as it were Gods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring Seal. Ay but it may be you will ſay, this is a great while to come. It may be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:133178:24"/>Ten, or Twenty, or Thirty, or Forty, years to come. Well, if thoſe do not ſatisfy you that you are ſealed, the Spirit alſo ſhall be an Earneſt of the Inheritance, an Earneſt of the future perſonal bleſſedneſs and glory which God hath bleſſed you with in Chriſt. It is not only Heaven, but the perſonal condition and ſtate of Saints in Heaven that is the glory of their Inheritance, and this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But then in the 8th place, another Spiritual bleſſing wherewith the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt does bleſs Chriſtians, is this: <hi>Practical experiences of the power of Gods grace in every providence, and ſuch as lay open to every Ordinance.</hi> I ſay, practical experiences of the power of Gods grace. O what can the grace of God do? Nay Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians what is it that the grace of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do? That grace that could ſend Chriſt out of his eternal manſion in the boſom of his Father, what cannot that grace do for thee? That grace that can empty (as it were) the Second perſon of the Trinity of his glory, doeſt thou think that this grace cannot empty thy heart of ſin? That grace that can fill the Covenant with ſuch a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Bleſſings, Poor worm, doeſt thou think that this grace cannot fill thy heart with Bleſſings? I pray Chriſtians, do but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:133178:25"/>conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith in the 19, and 20 verſes <hi>of this</hi> Chap. <hi>And what is,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the exceeding greatneſs of his power, to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power.</hi> If thy heart be hard, and be fixed within thee, ſo that thou doeſt oppoſe the work of Faith, he will work this work of faith with power; if it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hard, there is exceeding power, that the grace of God has the command of; if thou beeſt exceeding weak, there is exceeding grace that hath the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of exceeding power; ay, if thou beeſt exceeding unworthy, there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding grace that can exceedingly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look all thy unworthineſs. Now Chriſtians, practical experiences of the power of grace under the miniſtration of the Goſpel, is a great Spiritual Bleſſing. We have heard much of the grace of God, of the reſpective perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, what has this grace done for thy Soul? Art thou able to ſet to thy Seal that there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding power in the grace of the Father? and an exceeding power in the grace of the Son? if thou haſt not as yet experienced it, truly if there be but ſome beginnings of the power of God, and the finger of God hath but been upon thy heart, though in leſſer power, if there be exceeding power want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:133178:25"/>that exceeding power ſhall not always be ſuſpended; Practical experiences of the exceeding mighty power of God, is that which is a great Spiritual Bleſſing, which we are bleſſed with in Chriſt Jeſus, and for the illuſtration of this, do but compare this power, if thou needeſt as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding power, to raiſe up thy Soul from any Spiritual Death or Deadneſs, as Jeſus Chriſt ſtood in need of to raiſe him from the dead, that ſhall be at the diſpoſe of grace, that ſhall be imployed by grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adds in the next verſe, <hi>which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi> That power that raiſed the Son of man from the dead, and that power that ſet the Son of man at his own right hand in Heavenly places, thou, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſhalt have experience of it; and this is the Spiritual Bleſſing wherewith thou art bleſſed in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Bleſſed be the God, and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual bleſſings in Chriſt;</hi> that is, he hath Bleſſed us with a Right to an univerſal and unbounded experience of the power of his grace in all caſes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But the laſt that I ſhall mention is this: <hi>He hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual bleſſings, that is, an univerſal ſubjection of all our Spiritual Enemies under us.</hi> And I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:133178:26"/>think this may be lookt upon as a great Spiritual Bleſſing. It is true indeed, (my friends) all things are put under the feet of Jeſus Chriſt, but all things are not yet put under our feet: But that you may ſee the reaſon of this great priviledge, how grace hath laid it in Chriſt, do but obſerve thoſe paſſages that you have in <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22, 23. of this <hi>Chapter;</hi> at the 20 <hi>verſe, and hath ſet him at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principalities, and might, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and every name that is named, both in this World, and alſo in that which is to come.</hi> And (as if theſe two words could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all) the Apoſtle adds in general, <hi>and hath put all things under his feet.</hi> All things that are enemies to our Spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, all things that are Enemies unto our purification, unto our ſanctification, unto our inlightning and ſtrengthening, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any or all of our Spiritual bleſſings: <hi>He hath put all things under his feet.</hi>

Now, my friends, this is a great Spiritual bleſſing, and that the Spirit is concerned in this is evident.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:133178:27"/>Chapter had been crying out, <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed had too long lodged in his members, in the former part of the Chapter.

It is in my body ſays the Apoſtle, but, ſays he, the law of the Spirit of life hath made me free; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Hypotheſis the Apoſtle doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in <hi>verſe</hi> 11. That <hi>if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in us, then ſhall our mortal bodies be quickned,</hi> and diſpoſed alſo unto Spiritual ſervice; and if you do but obſerve it, the Apoſtle in the Concluſion of this diſcourſe gives ſuch an exhortation tending to this purpoſe, <hi>that they would not yield up their members as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs unto Sin;</hi> why ſo? becauſe the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwells in your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bodies, and therefore ſays he, don't yield your members don't yield your hands, and don't yield your tongues, and don't yield your ears, nor don't yield any of your members as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs unto Sin, becauſe the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwells in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:133178:27"/>your mortal bodies; and thus now I have taken notice of theſe diverſe Spiritual bleſſings, which the Apoſtle doth here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in by way of illuſtration of this great Goſpel myſtery of grace, and that is, that God hath bleſſed every Chriſtian with all Spiritual bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus, I will wave the reaſons, and I will alſo wave the reſolve of other inquiries that might be made, and wrap up all in theſe three or four inferences.</p>

Chriſtians, you ſhould be Spiritual in all manner of converſation; why? becauſe God hath bleſſed you in Chriſt Jeſus with all Spiritual bleſſings, for a man that pretends to this bleſſedneſs, for ſuch a one to be carnal, for ſuch a one to be earthly minded, for ſuch a one to be proud, for ſuch a one to be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:133178:28"/>debauched in his Spirit, and Principles, and Practices, how unbecoming is this to ſo great a pretence as you all make? If I ſhould come to you one by one, and ſay to you, friend, don't you hope that God hath bleſſed you with all Spiritual bleſſings in Chriſt? what means then this formality in duty? this is not to be Spiritual. What means this anger &amp; paſſion upon every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation? this does not argue that you are bleſſed with a Spirit of meekneſs; why my friends, if you be bleſſed with all Spiritual bleſſings, then I pray let all your Spiritual bleſſings appear more or leſs in your whole converſation; for a profeſſor that pretends to be ſo bleſſed, for him to be formal in his Prayer, and for him to be dead and dull in Duty, &amp; for him to be light, and vain, and frothy in his Converſation, this is not like one that is bleſſed with all Spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Chriſtians the inference is natural, if you be bleſſed with all Spiritual bleſſings, then ſhew forth all your Spiritual bleſſings in all your duties, be Spiritual in every thing. The Apoſtle has a parallel expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this, wherein he gives us an account of his converſation in the 3 <hi>Phil.</hi> 20. <hi>For our converſation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that is the</hi> firſt inference.</p>

It was Chriſts advice to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to lay up treaſure in Heaven, it is the practice of the grace of God; the grace of God hath done that which Jeſus Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed his diſciples and hearers to do.

With-hold not that from your Children which is their right, or at leaſt for ought you know may be their right; if you will not give it forth, I tell you God hath other ways, but you ſhall loſe the glory and honour of it. Let me tell you this, when we ſay that God hath bleſſed ſuch a child with a good Father; we mean that he hath bleſſed that Father with Spiritual bleſſings for the good of the child; and ſuch a one is happy and bleſſed in ſuch a Husband, what do we mean but this? that God hath bleſſed him

But Chriſtians, however it was with them, you know how it is with us; under ſecular, and temporal diſcouragements, it is the Chriſtians wiſdom to ſeek out for ſome Spiritual incouragements, when there ſeems to be a confederacy on Earth to encroach upon the remains of our temporal bleſſings, 'tis the intereſt of Chriſtians to look above, and to conſider what is the combination of Heaven, and the concurrence of the bleſſed Trinity about their Spiritual bleſſings. Chriſtians I do not know all your Eſtates, but this in general I may propoſe, if you be Chriſtians indeed, however it is with you here below, you are bleſſed with all, beyond all poſſibility of reverſe above, for ſays the Apoſtle here, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual bleſſings, in Heavenly places, in Chriſt.</hi> Three things lye wrapt up in the words.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a diſcovery of the Saints ſtate, his Scripture, Goſpel ſtate. It is an unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable and univerſal ſtate of Bleſſedneſs. It is not ſome ſingular, or ſome ſingle, pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bleſſing that is annexed and affixed, by an Irrevocable act of grace upon him, but it is all bleſſings, all Spiritual bleſſings.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:133178:32"/>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, You have the ſecurity of this their bleſſed ſtate diſcovered. It is not a bleſſedneſs lodged upon, or lodged in their own perſons, ſuch was <hi>Adams</hi> bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and you know what little ſafety and ſecurity there was in that. It is not a bleſſedneſs that is fixed here below: but it is a bleſſedneſs, that as to the principal Concerns of it is fixed above, in Heavenly places in Chriſt, not in Chriſtians, in an earthly Paradiſe, but in Heavenly places in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly. You have in theſe words the author of all this bleſſedneſs; and that is the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I have been diſcovering what thoſe Spiritual bleſſings are wherewith the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed every Chriſtian; my buſineſs at this time will lye in the reſolve of this inquiry.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An. </seg>
                  </label> With all plainneſs and brevity I ſhall endeavour to reſolve this inquiry, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it; and in the reſolve of it I ſhall not exceed not only the bounds of this Chapter, but of the words that I have read unto you: It is matter of wonder in Heaven, that a poor Chriſtian that hath an empty heart on Earth: That a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:133178:32"/>whoſe converſation, and whoſe duties are moſtly empty of Spiritual ſervice, ſhould be bleſſed with all Spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Certainly Sirs, the Angels in Heaven that are privy to this tranſaction of grace, are filled with admiration, that we that are ſenſeleſs of that grace, ſhould yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be ſo bleſſed. Thoſe glorious Spirits that never offended, that they ſhould have but their meaſures proportioned to their practices, and that we ſhould have our meaſures preſſed down, and running over gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us, notwithſtanding our general principles and practices are againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Heaven. It is matter of wonder to a ſerious Chriſtian, a Chriſtian that makes it his buſineſs to inquire and examine his own frame, both by Goſpel promiſes and by Goſpel priviledges; what, Lord! I that do ſo little, bleſſed with all? What, Lord! I that have ſo little in my own heart and ſpirit, yet I bleſſed with all? Will nothing ſatisfie the grace of God but all bleſſings, and all Spiritual bleſſings too? My Friends, I hope it is in your hearts thus to admire; but I will give you the reaſons: And there ſeem to be theſe five lodged in the words. I ſhall take notice of them as they lye before us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Don't wonder Sirs, that you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are bleſſed with all Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. For,</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:133178:33"/>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>God is the God of Chriſt; he is the God of our Lord, and of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is a great reaſon, yea this is Gods Reaſon why he does bleſs Chriſtians; I am the God of that Lord that is their Lord, and my Friends, I pray conſider it; This relation that God ſtands in unto Chriſt has a general aſpect upon all the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are here mentioned of Chriſt. All Chriſts principal Relations are here taken notice of by the Apoſtle, and expreſſed; as now he is the God of Jeſus, he is the God of our Lord Jeſus, he is the God of the Lord of the Goſpel, he is the God of the Jeſus of the Goſpel, and the God of the Chriſt that is the anointed of the Goſpel; ſo the Apoſtle in his other Epiſtles, as if he ſeemed to take great pleaſure and delight in this general Relation that he here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he alſo ſeems to expreſs it in his Preface to his other Epiſtles. I think the Epiſtle that he writ to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> comes neareſt to this Epiſtle that he writ to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> for its Goſpel import and nature. And in the verſe 3 of the 1 <hi>Col.</hi> you find the Apoſtle thus delivering himſelf; <hi>We give thanks to God, and (or even) the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, praying always for you.</hi> The God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; I pray Conſider it, I would illuſtrate this in theſe two Branches.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:133178:33"/>
               <p>The Firſt is this, <hi>That all the advantages of Gods being a God to any, is ſumm'd up in his being a God to Chriſt.</hi> I ſay all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the covenant, all the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that are diſcovered as eſſential to Gods being a God to any in either Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is ſumm'd up in this relation of his unto Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore you ſhall find that he promiſes ſo much to him, and that with reference to the diſcharge of all or of every particular office of his. I have not time to inſtance in them, I ſhall only remind you of one paſſage, and that is, when Chriſt came to die, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to God of himſelf, he conſiders himſelf in and under all his Goſpel Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: The Lord imployed him as his God, to preach Salvation unto ſinners: The Lord as his God imployed him as his ſervant, to rule and govern Saints: The Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed him as he was his God to reconcile his enemies to himſelf, by offering up his Soul and his Body a propitiation for them; and therefore with reſpect to all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, I pray conſider what ſtreſs he laid upon this, for there ſeems to be ſomething particular, and I think the Jews in the heat of their rage miſtook the Emphaſis of their own language, in <hi>Mark</hi> 15.34. And at the ninth hour: Jeſus cryed with a loud voice,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:133178:34"/>ſaying <hi>Eloi, Eloi, that is, my God, my God:</hi> The Jews miſtake <hi>Eloi</hi> here, ſay they verſe 35. <hi>behold he calleth</hi> Elias, verſe 36. <hi>let alone, let us ſee whether</hi> Elias <hi>will come to take him down,</hi> which was a thing quite of another Import and Nature. The proper interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is given there by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>my God, my God,</hi> ſays he. My God, my God, you ſee my friends the Lord owned his Relation to him as his God, now at this time, when he was to come to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to him of the diſcharge of all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Relations, <hi>Eloi, Eloi, my God, my God,</hi> I have preached thy will; My God, my God, I have governed according to thy will; My God, my God, I have made propitiation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy will; this ſeem to be the meaning of it, and upon this account he grounds his petition, why haſt thou forſaken me, or why wilt thou or doeſt thou forſake me? As if he ſhould appeal to God, My God thou knoweſt I have preached all thy heart; and my God, thou knoweſt I have governed according to the ſecrets of thy heart; and my God, thou knoweſt I have been tender both of Saints and ſinners, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Command I received from thee; and my God, there is nothing that I have refuſed or avoided to do to pleaſe thee; my God, thou knoweſt all this. Now
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:133178:34"/>Sirs, here is great reaſon why we ſhould be Bleſſed with all Spiritual Bleſſings, he is the Lords God in whom we are bleſſed.</p>
               <p>The Second thing that I would urge as an illuſtration of the former particular, is this: <hi>That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtands in no Relations to God but the bleſſedneſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation redounds to Chriſtians.</hi> We will ſuppoſe the Lord Chriſt pleaſing his God in the diſcharge of all his Offices, and Relations, we will ſuppoſe him, I ſay, in fulneſs of communion with his God in the execution of all his Relations. Now Sirs, I pray do but obſerve the Apoſtle in that peculiar appropriating word; he doth not ſay, The God and Father of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but the God and Father of our Lord; as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, ye Chriſtian <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> (and ſo I may ſay, ye Chriſtians of differing apprehenſions) you that are Chriſtians indeed, all the bleſſedneſſes and advantages of Gods Relation to Chriſt, as his God, redound to you, for he is your Lord; and I will only confirm what I have now obſerved to you, by an obſervation ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this, and upon another Scripture, if you reflect upon the 2 verſe of this Chap. you ſhall find that before the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Gods Relation to Chriſt, he mentions his Relation to us; ſays he, <hi>Grace be unto
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:133178:35"/>you from God our Father.</hi> From God our Father, as if the Apoſtle would have us to underſtand, that whatſoever he is to Chriſt he is that to Chriſtians in Chriſt. And there is the firſt reaſon why God doth bleſs us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt, becauſe he is Chriſts God, and hath approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and carried himſelf towards Chriſt as his God, in all the circumſtances wherein Chriſt was or is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly. <hi>He is not only the God of Chriſt, and therefore bleſſes us, but he is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt, and therefore doth bleſs us.</hi> Which ſeems to be a Relation which our Lord doth moſt glory in in both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I tell you, Chriſtians, God glories more in the Relation of a Father to Chriſt, then he doth in the Relation of a Creator to the whole World; I will open this alſo in theſe two Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And the firſt is this, <hi>That Chriſt Jeſus's Relation to God, or Gods Relation to Chriſt as a Father, in which he doth ſo glory, is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that he bears to the Humane Nature.</hi> It is not his Relation to Chriſt as the Second Perſon of the Trinity that is the glory of God in the Goſpel, but his Relation to Chriſt as God-man, or as man. That is the great Relation that God glories in in both Teſtaments. The Relation that God ſtands in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:133178:35"/>unto Chriſt as the ſecond Perſon of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is natural. It is a natural Relation. But the Relation in which he ſtands to Chriſt as man, this is the glory of God in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel. The Lord by his Spirit open it unto you. I will endeavour to open it by opening of two Scriptures. The firſt ſhall be a paſſage in the Old Teſtament in the 2 <hi>Pſal.</hi> After the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt had given us an account of the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous rage of the Heathen, and the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy of the people with the Heathen in their Rage, at the 1 <hi>verſe. Wherefore do the Heathen Rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</hi> After he had ſtated the reſult of all their Counſels againſt him which is applied to him as man by the Apoſtle in the 4 <hi>Acts</hi> 25 <hi>verſe</hi> and ſo on. The Pſalmiſt brings in the Lord glorying in this, verſe 6. <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of</hi> Sion; and Chriſt ſolacing himſelf peculiarly in this Relation that he ſtands in to him as the Son of man, verſe 7. <hi>The Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> That this has Relation to the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt and to him as man, I pray conſider a paſſage there in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.5. <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time.</hi> To which of the Angels ſaid he? No, there is no reaſon why he ſhould ſay ſo to them, if we
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:133178:36"/>conſider him as God, as very God. But if we conſider him as the Son of man, there is great reaſon that the Apoſtle ſhould bring this in, unto which of the Angels hath he ſaid, that he ſhould paſs by all the Angels in Heaven and never ſay unto them or any of them, thou art my Son? But upon the appearance of the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> the reputed Son of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Carpenters Son, when he brings him into the World, he ſaith in a way of glory, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time thou art my Son? But to the only begotten Son this he ſaith; that is the firſt illuſtration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second illuſtration of it is this; <hi>That the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders himſelf as his Father for our ſakes.</hi> I pray obſerve it. God had never been a Father to the man Jeſus, had it not been for our ſakes. I mean there had never been ſuch a Relation in being, had not Chriſtians eternal bleſſedneſs lien at the bottom of it. So that I may truly ſay, Chriſtians, it was our Spiritual concern that gave being to this glorious mutual Relation between the Father and the Son of man; what need he ever to have made him man, had it not been for the Sons, and Daughters, of men, whom he had an eternal and an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:133178:36"/>kindneſs for? I have ſometimes with pleaſure reviewed the paſſage that paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Angel and the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> about the birth of Chriſt, give me leave to obſerve one or two things out of it in <hi>Luke</hi> 1.28, 29. <hi>verſes. Mary</hi> ſhe wonders at the ſalutation of the Angel, and well ſhe might; a poor Woman fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to make a Carpenters Wife of; a poor Virgin eſpouſed to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was of the houſe of <hi>David;</hi> and that no meaner an Angel then <hi>Gabriel,</hi> muſt be ſent to her, to declare the tidings; and what were the tidings? the tidings were that out of her Body, and in her Womb ſhould be begotten one that ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Son of God, in the 35 verſe. <hi>And the Angel anſwered and ſaid unto her, the Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo that holy thing that ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I pray what was the buſineſs of this holy thing, and what was the Fundamental rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this great and wonderful tranſaction and condeſcenſion of Chriſt? The Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental reaſon was this; God had an Eternal kindneſs for ſuch ſinners as you and I are, and a deſign to make us Children of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we had violated our Childſhip
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:133178:37"/>by nature: When we had tranſgreſſed the Law of our Creation Childhood, he was reſolved to make us Children of Adoption, and therefore it was that the Holy Ghoſt muſt come upon her, and the power of the higheſt muſt overſhadow her. Chriſt as the Son of God became the Son of man was made the Son of man meerly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally with a deſign of grace upon the Sons and Daughters of men, and therefore Sirs, if ſo, no great wonder that God ſhould bleſs us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Reaſon is this; <hi>He in whom we are bleſſed, is our ſtated Lord, he is our abſolute, our Soveraign, our certain and our ſtated Lord:</hi> and therefore you ſhall find the Apoſtle here expreſſing it, bleſſed be the God and Father of <hi>Our Lord,</hi> who hath bleſſed us, <hi>Our Lord,</hi> that is, God hath given him to be our Lord, an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Lord unto Chriſtians in all their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian concerns, and therefore when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle preached the Goſpel to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Friends, at their Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle (as I may ſo call it) at their Chriſtian meeting in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s houſe, do but obſerve how he expreſſes himſelf, and introduces his diſcourſe, <hi>Acts.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> 36. <hi>The word which God ſent unto the Children of Iſrael, preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:133178:37"/>Lord of all,</hi> here is the word which God ſent unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> what is it? It is a word of peace; what is at the bottom of it? Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>Lord of all,</hi> that is, he is Lord of all that grace, that concerns our peace; he is Lord of all the pardons that concern our peace; he is Lord of all the wiſdom, that concerns and relates to our peace, he is Lord of all the relations, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of our peace, and he is Lord of all things, and of the bleſſings of all things, in thoſe Goſpel relations, preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt, he is Lord of all. Now Chriſtians, I pray do but Conſider, what is the Spiritual bleſſing that you ſtand in need of? God hath made Chriſt the Lord of that bleſſing; you want peace, and you want comfort, and you want Joy, and you want this, and that, and the other, God hath made Chriſt Lord of all, and if he be Lord of all, then my Friends no wonder, that God hath bleſſed us with all in him.</p>
               <p>But I will open this likewiſe in theſe two Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. and the Firſt is this, <hi>God had a peculiar relation to Chriſts Lordſhip unto and over our perſons, when he did intruſt him with all our bleſſings;</hi> our Lord bears teſtimony of this in general in many places, but eſpecially in the ſhutting up of his miniſtry, and of his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:133178:38"/>life here below, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and teach all nations,</hi> go ye therefore. Wherefore? At the 18 <hi>verſe</hi> All power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth; if he had had only power given him in Heaven he could not have Bleſſed ſinners on Earth, if he had had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer given him only on Earth he could not have commanded the Bleſſings of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But, ſays he, all power, all authority is given to me in Heaven and in Earth. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all nations.</hi> Lord to what end (might the diſciples ſay) muſt we go? Well ſays Chriſt, I am the Lord of all the Bleſſings, I have an abſolute power to diſpoſe of all the Bleſſings of Heaven, and to manage all the heavenly Bleſſings upon Earth. Therefore ſays he, <hi>Go preach, go teach all nations:</hi> Go tell ſinners that I am ready to bleſs them, I have a heart that is willing to bleſs them, I have a treaſure to ſupply them fully, according to all their neceſſities, and according to all their ſtraits. Go preach the Goſpel to every creature, to every Saint and to every ſinner; I am Lord of all; and therefore if you do obſerve it, the commiſſion that Chriſt gives to his diſciples, to his Miniſters, has a peculiar reference unto the Authority that he hath received, all the authority that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:133178:38"/>hath a peculiar reference to them, and therefore it muſt needs diſcover, that whatſoever he received as Soveraign he received for us; and therefore no wonder that God bleſſes us with all in him, becauſe he hath made him Lord of all. Chriſtians, want you peace? Chriſt is Lord of it. Want you grace? Chriſt is the Anointed Lord of grace; he hath made him Lord of all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>The Lordſhip that Jeſus Chriſt hath in and over us that are to be Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and in and over all the bleſſings that are to be conferred upon us, he doth mannage and execute in a way accommodated to the general and particular caſes of every Chriſtian.</hi> As now ſuppoſe that I or any of you were made Lord of the treaſures that are lodged up for the poor, It may be there is one that cannot ſtir out of doors, and there is another that it may be can ſtir, but cannot come at the time, and to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, others may, it may be, ſome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not becauſe of natural infirmities; now the Lord, he that is the Lord Treaſurer, the Lord Diſpoſer of all thoſe bleſſings he can accommodate himſelf to the conditions of every one, he can go from houſe to houſe to ſee how many poor there are, and what it is that you want; do you want Bread, or
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:133178:39"/>do you want Drink? or do you want clothes? what is it that you want? I ſee you cannot come abroad, and I am come to ſee your wants: truly ſo my Friends our Lord Chriſt can accommodate himſelf to every ones condition, he ſees that poor creatures cannot make out unto him, one is blind, and another is lame, and another is dead-hearted and diſcouraged, and another is tempted and fettered, and cannot go out unto the Lord, ay but the Lord can come to them, he can come to your cottages, to your houſes, and the Lord can accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date himſelf to you, &amp; ſay to you, Children, what want you? Children, what ails you? God hath made me Lord of all Spiritual bleſſings for you, what want you? want you wiſdom? and want you ſtrength; and want you peace; and want you grace? what is it that you want? I ſee you cannot come to me, becauſe you want ſtrength, and you want a heart to come, but I can come to you, and I am come to you. Thus the Lord of all can accommodate himſelf. It was a great offence that the Scribes, thoſe devout &amp; ſuperſtitious Phariſees took againſt Chriſt that he could accommodate himſelf to the Publicans and Harlots, and ſinners of the day, that could not come out to him, but he muſt go to them, and feaſt with them, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:133178:39"/>this was an offence to them. O ſays Chriſt, I am ſent to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the ſheep do not ſeek the ſhepherd, but the ſhepherd is to ſeek the ſheep: a poor creature, it may be, cannot come to the Lord Jeſus, yet he, notwithſtanding all his Lordſhip, and all his grandure, and all his greatneſs, I tell you Sirs, he is ſuch a Lord as can accommodate himſelf to the conditions of every one, and therefore no wonder that the God of all grace hath intruſted him with all, and hath bleſſed us with all Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſings in him, that is the Lord and Maſter of ſo much grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The 4th reaſon is this, we are bleſſed with all Spiritual Bleſſings in him, <hi>Becauſe he is the Jeſus of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> When the Angel by a ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was ſent from God to name the Child, he gives him this name, <hi>Matt.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> it ſeems, was an honeſt, a ſober and a good man, and upon that he had a mind to put away <hi>Mary</hi> privily that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed to him, but the Angel appeared to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> verſe 20. and ſaid unto him, <hi>Joſeph, thou Son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſhe ſhall bring forth a Son, and thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:133178:40"/>Now my Friends, if you do but obſerve how the Juſtice of God hath ſtated the Method of this Salvation, you will ſee reaſon enough why God ſhould bleſs us with all the Bleſſings of our Salvation in him, I will open this alſo in theſe two Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Juſtice of God hath ſtated the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of our Salvaton to be in a way of ſuffering, and in a way of purchaſe:</hi> That we ſhould have no pardons but what ſhould be the price of blood, that we ſhould have no peace but what ſhould be the price of blood, that we ſhould have no communion, but what blood is at the bottom of, that we ſhould have no manner of fellowſhip with God, here or hereafter, but what is laid and founded in the blood of the Son of God; this was the way and method that the Juſtice of God had ſtated. Says Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. <hi>Sacrifice and Offerings thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me; in burnt Offerings and Sacrifices for ſin thou haſt had no pleaſure, then ſaid I, Lo I come to do thy will, O God:</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord is there any peace to be purchaſed for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors? here is my blood: Is there any grace to be bought for ſinners? Lord here is my blood for it: Is there any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to be wrought? I am willing to offer my ſelf to be a propitiation, for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:133178:40"/>thy Enemies; Lo here I am, Lord is there any Spiritual Bleſſing to be obtained by ſuffering? Lo I come to do thy will, though it be to be made a curſe. Now Chriſtians, if the caſe be ſo? is there not great reaſon then that the Bleſſings that we have, we ſhould be bleſſed with them in Chriſt? <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But then the Second Illuſtration of it is this; <hi>Jeſus as a Saviour muſt not only be a ſufferer, but a Surety.</hi> He muſt be one that muſt undertake to reſpond to God for all, and to ſatisfy the juſtice of God for all. Now Sirs, what are the Bleſſings that we receive by his Suretiſhip? Why truly upon the account of that we receive all Spiritual Bleſſings. Chriſt is Surety, that I ſhould live like a Child of Adoption, for the ſubſtance and main, that my heart ſhould be in a frame becoming thoſe that are the Lords Adopted ones. O but where is he that hath undertaken it? why it is Jeſus, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall find the Apoſtle fix it upon this very title <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. <hi>by ſo much was Jeſus made a Surety of a better Teſtament; by ſo much was Jeſus:</hi> You ſee here is the very Title that is given him in the Text: Jeſus the Saviour, and Jeſus the Surety for all that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:133178:41"/>are ſaved; and therefore good reaſon that we ſhould be Bleſſed with all Spiritual bleſſings in him. And then,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, The 5th reaſon that is in the words is this; he hath Bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in him, <hi>becauſe he is the Chriſt:</hi> I pray do but obſerve it, he is the Chriſt: And therefore good reaſon that all our Bleſſings ſhould be lodged in him. There is not another Chriſt in Heaven, there was none of all the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that were fit to make a Chriſt of, all the Sons, and Daughters of men, put them all together, were not fit to make a Chriſt of, vain are the ſuppoſitions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of the Papiſts. There is none but this Jeſus that is fit to make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chriſt of, and this Jeſus was anointed with all Spiritual Bleſſings to this end, he was anointed with them in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in the principle. I will but turn you to one Scripture for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this, that Jeſus was anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all Spiritual bleſſings for this purpoſe; I pray do but obſerve that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage there, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 61.1. verſe. <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me.</hi> I pray conſider it Sirs, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for or wherewith he hath anointed me. And
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:133178:41"/>this is the Oyl of gladneſs wherewith he was anointed above all his fellows. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath anointed me, <hi>To preach good tidings to the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening the Priſon to them that are Bound,</hi> &amp;c. I pray do but conſider how he brings in the thing to my preſent purpoſe, all Spiritual Bleſſings. Thou art a poor creature, a weak creature, not worthy of the leaſt crumb of Bread, and yet my Friends, all things are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Lord Chriſt, becauſe he was anointed with all for us, therefore is it that we are bleſſed with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt.</p>

               <p>THe ſtate and Condition of this Church of Chriſt at <hi>Epheſus</hi> we have in ſome meaſure opened. The ſuitableneſs of this paſſage of the Apoſtle to that their ſtate we have alſo diſcovered. To be deprived of Temporal Bleſſings and expoſed to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Troubles and Trials, as well as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Temptations, is eaſily ballanced with the diſcovery the Apoſtle here makes of being Bleſſed with all Spiritual Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>This univerſal word is not only applied to the kinds, but alſo to the degrees of every kind of theſe Spiritual Bleſſings. It is all for the kind, and all alſo of every kind; not only faith, or only love, but both; not only pardon, or only peace, but both; and not only ſo, but all of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:133178:42"/>all; who hath Bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings. Though you have but little in hand, or, as I may rather ſay, little in your own hearts, yet you have all Spiritual Bleſſings in the hand of Chriſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I would ſpeak theſe myſteries with all plainneſs. But my Friends, there is none of you, thoſe that have the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of parts and gifts, that can underſtand practically what I ſhall ſay without the Spirit of the Lord lead you into the truth, which I ſhall diſcover to you (I hope) in the Spirit. In the proſecution therefore of it, I will only deliver my ſenſe in theſe Four, or Five, Generals, and then make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is this, when we ſay that God, as the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt, bleſſes us, this ſeems to be implyed in it, <hi>That all the advantages that any of the people of God in either Teſtament have by Gods being their God, or that hangeth upon this relation, they are all ſumm'd up in this, that he, as the God of our Lord Jeſus, bleſſes his people with all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſſings:</hi> If ſo be that you reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Old Teſtament, you ſhall find <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> greatly glorying in this, and the Lord laying it as a foundation of <hi>Abrahams</hi> glory, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. ſays he, <hi>I am God all ſufficient, walk before me and be thou perfect;</hi> and <hi>Chap</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. you have another ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of God to <hi>Abraham:</hi> Says he, <hi>I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:133178:43"/>am thy ſhield, and thy exceeding great reward:</hi> Now Sirs, I pray Conſider, The man Jeſus, the Lord Jeſus, as betruſted with all our Spiritual bleſſings, lies under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this relation to God, if ſo be that God be the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> much more will he be an <hi>all ſufficient</hi> God in the manage of the concerns of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, as the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt he hath bleſſed us, as an all ſufficient God, as a God that is the exceeding great reward of thoſe to whom he is God, able to do what he will, and able to give what he pleaſes, he is Chriſts God that hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual bleſſings in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>This alſo doth diſcover a full aſſurance of an abiding ingagement of all the attributes of God to carry on the intereſt and the concerns of Chriſt, as it is ſtated among Chriſtians;</hi> I ſay it implies an ingagement of all the attributes of God to ſee to the bleſſings; I pray Chriſtians don't look upon the man Jeſus only as concerned in the mannage, either in the ſecuring or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the bleſſings, but look upon the bleſſings enſured, ſecured and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or mannaged in their diſpoſal by him that is the God of the man Jeſus; you know the paſſage there in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where the Lord doth Covenant with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:133178:44"/>Chriſts Type, that is, with <hi>David,</hi> and with <hi>Solomon,</hi> but principally with the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus himſelf, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.26. <hi>He ſhall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God, and the Rock of my Salvation. David</hi> glories in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion himſelf, and he ſpeaks this by way of propheſy, to give aſſurance unto all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, that <hi>Davids</hi> Son ſhall have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and a heart to cry unto him in all his ſtraits: <hi>My God,</hi> he ſhall cry unto me, <hi>My Father,</hi> thou art <hi>My Father, and my God.</hi> Now I pray do but obſerve the Context, and you ſhall find, that the great concerns of the people of God, their great Bleſſings are here devolved upon him to manage, verſe 19. <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one Choſen out of the people.</hi> A mighty one indeed there is none to be compared to him, exalted indeed above all, he hath a name given him which is above every name, and ſays God, <hi>I have laid help upon him.</hi> As if the Lord ſhould ſay, I will betruſt him with all their perſons and I will betruſt him with all their Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. I know he is mighty, he is able to ſave, ay but leſt he ſhould be diſcouraged or leſt any looking upon him as the Son of <hi>David</hi> ſhould judge him inſufficient for this imploy, I pray do but obſerve what he ſays in the 24 <hi>verſe. But my faithfulneſs
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:133178:44"/>and my mercy ſhall be with him, and in my name ſhall his horn be exalted. I will ſet his hand alſo in the Sea and his right hand in the the Rivers, and he ſhall cry unto me, thou art my God.</hi> By way of acknowledgment for what hath been done, thou art <hi>My God:</hi> O this is <hi>my God</hi> that hath done all this. It is he in whoſe name my Horn is exalted. It is he that ſhall beat down my foes before my face, and plague them that hate me; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good reaſon he ſhould acknowledge him; he ſhall cry unto me, my God, and if there be any thing of difficulty to be done, if there be ſin to be removed; if the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſin had ſeized, and that to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, ſays God to him, he ſhall cry unto me, <hi>My God;</hi> and I pray, friends, do but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how correſpondent to this propheſy, or to this promiſe, was the carriage of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in all his ſtraits, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the general diſpenſation under which he was, which was a diſpenſation full enough of ſtraits, how the Apoſtle ſpeaks of him, or rather brings him in, as fixing upon himſelf, in the 2 Heb. 13. <hi>And again, ſays he, I will put my truſt in him; and again, behold I and the Children which God hath given me.</hi> The concerns of the Children are here upon the heart of Chriſt, and ſays Chriſt, I will put my truſt in him; in whom?
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:133178:45"/>in my God, that hath given me theſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in my God that hath given Bleſſings to me for them. I will put my truſt in him, ſays he; and again behold I and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that God hath given me. And when he was in the greateſt ſtrait of all, when God ſeemed to withdraw from him, and he under the guilt of all the ſins of the whole election of grace, and Juſtice executing vengeance, or the Curſe, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Covenant upon him, God frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon him, then he had recourſe to this, to the power of God, to the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, to the attributes of God; <hi>My God, My God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Nay my Friends, let me tell you this as an additional illuſtration of it; That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath full liberty and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to demand the univerſal aſſiſtance of all the attributes of the Divine nature in the manage of this work of Mediation as he is Man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Third General is this; <hi>What ever Relation God as God is diſcovered under in either Teſtaments, the incouragements, and all the bleſſedneſſes of that Relation, meet in this his Relation to Chriſt.</hi> He is the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt, and as ſo, he hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual bleſſings in him. There are diverſe Relations that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:133178:45"/>God is pleaſed to cloth himſelf withal, and to repreſent himſelf under unto his people, in the Old and New Teſtament; Now what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thoſe Relations are, The advantage, &amp; the bleſſedneſs that reſult from them, meet here in this, &amp; that in this particular caſe, <hi>as he is a God bleſſing Chriſtians in Chriſt;</hi> I would illuſtrate this to you in theſe 2 particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God hath diſcovered himſelf under the notion of a Creator,</hi> as God the Creator of all fleſh, the Creator of all things, ſo he hath declared himſelf to be; And yet, my Friends, the advantages that are wrapt up in this Relation, are all ſumm'd up in this, that he is the God and Father of our Lord, bleſſing Chriſtians with all Spiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. May a poor Creature ſay, O my heart will never yield to theſe Spiritual Bleſſings, they are ſo Spiritual, and I am ſo carnal; ay but God the Creator of thy heart hath bleſſed thee with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt. O, ſays a poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſhall never be able to underſtand, nor to receive theſe Spiritual Myſteries, which wrap up as it were theſe Spiritual bleſſings, I am ſo full of Spiritual blindneſs, darkneſs, and Ignorance; ay but God that created thy underſtanding, and created thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in light, as an underſtanding reſembling his own, this God hath bleſſed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:133178:46"/>thee with theſe Spiritual bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus; ay but I am ſo weak, &amp; I am ſo unable to manage them, Well notwithſtanding all, God that created thee; It is he that hath bleſſed thee with all Spiritual bleſſings in Chriſt, &amp; that as the God and Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and as he is conſidered the Creator of all by Chriſt, ſo he hath bleſſed thee with all Spiritual bleſſings, The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians, Chap.</hi> 1. ſeems to argue from this principle, and encourage (from this myſtery) poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to wait for the Bleſſing, <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>for it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwell;</hi> ay but how ſhall I come to be made partaker of that fulneſs that dwels in Chriſt? my heart hath been ſhut ſo many years, who will open it? my heart hath been growing in hardneſs ſo many years who can ſoften it? Now obſerve, before the diſcovery of this the pleaſure of his grace, he brings in the diſcovery of this Relation of a Creator, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. <hi>For by him were all things Created that are in Heaven and that are in Earth,</hi> &amp;c, by him were all things Created, and it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell, and therefore he can Create thy heart, that is hard, he can Create it ſoft, and in thy heart, that is ſo ſhut up, he can Create an open
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:133178:46"/>paſſage for the Goſpel, and the Bleſſings of the Goſpel, out of the hands of Chriſt, into thy heart, he can create this; Now, my friends, this is a great advantage, the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the Creator hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>Another Relation that God hath diſcovered himſelf in, as God, unto us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is a Relation of Supportation, importing a governing of all things that are.</hi> A God whoſe eyes run to and fro throughout the Earth obſerving both the evil and the good; Therefore you ſhall find that when the great concerns of the Church were before him; he appeared thus as an Univerſal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord and Governour of all things, of all powers and all intereſts whatſoever; you have it in the 1 of <hi>Zach.</hi> There were ſome grand objections that lay in the way of that mercy, that God had betruſted in the hand of Chriſt, to manage for and on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his poor deſpiſed &amp; afflicted people; You have the management of it diſcovered to be betruſted with him in the 8 verſe. <hi>I ſaw by night, and behold A man riding upon a Red Horſe; and he ſtood among the Myrtle Trees that were in the bottom, and behind him were there Red Horſes ſpeckled and White.</hi> Here was the caſe and concerns of the

Now my friends here was a great work that did lie upon him, and he hath his Servants, thoſe that were behind him upon Red Horſes ſpeckled and White. <hi>What are theſe?</hi> ſaies the Prophet to the Lord; And the Angel anſwered, <hi>Theſe are they that the Lord hath ſent to walk to and fro through the Earth.</hi> This Angel is the man that ſtood among the Myrtles, this is the man that in <hi>verſe</hi> 8 was riding upon a Red Horſe, and in <hi>verſe</hi> 9 the Prophet calls him his Lord; <hi>O my Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>what are theſe?</hi> Then, <hi>verſe</hi> 11, you have an account given unto this angel, unto this man that ſtood among the Myrtle Trees of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions in the World, and the account is this: <hi>We have walked to and fro through the Earth, and behold all the Earth ſitteth ſtill, and is at reſt.</hi> You may at your leiſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Context, and you ſhall find that there was a great work here to do, great Bleſſings, to beſtow upon a poor deſpiſed, contemned people, and the manage of it was caſt upon the man that ſtood among
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:133178:47"/>the Myrtle Trees, and this man had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the encouragement of the Lords Relation, as he is the Supream and Soveraign Lord of all; ſo that I ſay, my friends, if ſo be that the Soveraignty of the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as he is the Supream Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all, and as he is Lord of all, can be of any advantage unto us, here lies the advantage of it, that the God of our Lord Jeſus is not only the great creating God, but the great governing God that hath bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſſings. O, ſays a poor trembling Soul, I can never ſecure my Bleſſings from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, my heart is ſo treacherous and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and <hi>Satan</hi> ſo ſubtile and powerful, I can never ſecure them. Well, my friends, but who is he that hath Bleſſed you? Even God, the God of Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, who is the Abſolute, Soveraign Governour of all the whole Creation; He it is that hath Bleſſed you with all Spiritual Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>I will but only obſerve this one thing to you: Though the Devil and the powers of the World have caſt off Gods Moral government, yet God hath no way at all, by all their ſin, leſſened his natural Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; As he was ſo he is, he is as much the Soveraign Lord and Governour of all things; now the Devils have ſinned and man has
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:133178:48"/>ſinned; and both man and Devils have caſt off his moral government; he is as much Lord and abſolute Soveraign as he was, and would have been if they had not ſinned.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God, as the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, bleſſes us; that is <hi>He ſtands under engagement, as Chriſts God and Father, to ſecure what he hath given to us in Chriſt.</hi> As I obſerved to you before it is not only our God and Father in Chriſt, but it is the God and Father of Chriſt, that hath bleſſed us in Chriſt, and if ſo, then he ſtands engaged unto Chriſt, in whom he hath lodged theſe Bleſſings for us, or in whom he hath bleſſed us with theſe Bleſſing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to ſecure them unto us; The more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate engagement lay between God and Chriſt Jeſus. It is a more remote relation and ſo by conſequence, an engagement at a greater diſtance, or an engagement upon a remove that he ſtands in unto us that are Chriſtians. I would fain have you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this, I ſay he is the God of Chriſt that hath bleſſed us, and therefore as he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the God of Chriſt he ſtands engaged unto Chriſt Jeſus; there lay the firſt and the principal engagement? 'Tis true as he is ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God he is not to be queſtioned. <hi>I am God</hi> ſaies he, <hi>I change not and therefore, ye Sons of</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:133178:48"/>Jacob <hi>are not conſumed, Mal.</hi> 3.6. But, my friends, he is not only the God of the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and therefore they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, but he is the God of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. Why? Becauſe as he is Chriſts God he hath bleſſed us, and ſo he ſtands engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Now I pray obſerve but theſe two things;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is this, <hi>There was never any thing of offence that ever paſſed between this God, and this Chriſt.</hi> The Father was never offended by the Son, and the Son was never offended by the Father, theſe alwaies kept a good, a perfect, a full correſpondency each with other; indeed ſometimes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath reaſon to fear; My God I have provoked, and my God I have diſhonoured, and my God I have forſaken, and my God I have ſlighted. Ay, Chriſtian, thou mayeſt ſay ſo, but it is Blaſphemy for thee to ſay or think, that ever Chriſt could ſay ſo; in truth he never provoked his God, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſhonoured his God, he never did any thing that might diſoblige his God, Chriſt never did; He in whom thou art bleſſed: it is God, as the God of Chriſt, that hath bleſſed thee, and therefore, Chriſtian, great encouragement there is unto thy Soul.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>As he is Chriſts God, all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:133178:49"/>were not only ſummed up in him that were made to Chriſtians, but the Bleſſedneſs of all the promiſes have a primary reſpect and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto him.</hi> My meaning plainly is this, God hath promiſed thee peace, Ay but this peace hath reference unto the honouring and glorifying of the man Jeſus, Whoſe God hath Bleſſed thee with this peace in him. Jeſus hath the glory of all, and God eyes the glory of Jeſus in all the promiſes he makes to us; and ſo, my friends, all the promiſes were not only deſignedly given for the advancement of him, but all the promiſes were ſummed up in him. When God made the promiſe of a ſeed to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Abraham</hi> had enough, he was under ſome diſcontent before, but now, ſays God, I will not only give thee a Child, one to be thine Heir, but I will give thee a Son, and that Son that I will give thee, ſhall be my Heir; <hi>One in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhall be Bleſſed.</hi> Now <hi>Abraham</hi> had enough; you never find <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more Children at the hands of God; no, having an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a ſeed in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Now <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſatisfyed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in the propheſy of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> doth thus explain himſelf, when he promiſeth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:133178:49"/>
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4. <hi>Behold I have given him for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (or a Covenant) to the people.</hi> I will give <hi>him.</hi> Who? <hi>I will give my Son Jeſus for a Covenant to the people;</hi> That is as much as if God ſhould ſay, I will give him for <hi>All,</hi> he is as it were the Sums and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all, ſay but Chriſt, and you ſay <hi>All.</hi> When God gives Chriſt to a poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he gives all the <hi>Promiſes, all the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and all the Bleſſings of Earth, and all the Bleſſings of Heaven, all the Bleſſings of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and all the Bleſſings that are reſerved in the everlaſting Manſions.</hi> And thus now you ſee in theſe reſpects upon what account it is, that the Apoſtle ſeems to lay the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis upon this word: <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath Bleſſed us with all Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give you but 3 or 4 inferences.</p>

                  <hi>Is it ſo, my friends, that God as the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath Bleſſed Chriſtians with all Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings?</hi> Then,</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, <hi>Vain are the attempts of any of the enemies of Chriſtians to interpoſe between them and their Bleſſings.</hi> Though they may ſometimes interpoſe between them and ſome of the means of their Bleſſings, yet I ſay, vain are the attempts of their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:133178:50"/>enemies againſt their Bleſſings; Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that God, as the God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt, hath bleſſed them with all Bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Now you may obſerve that the Devil hath been all along at it, and he makes it his deſign &amp; buſineſs, from time to time, &amp; from age to age, and from diſpenſation to diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to interpoſe between the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and their Bleſſings, but ſtill in vain; and therefore the Pſalmiſt eyeing the Lord Jeſus, and eying by faith, this bleſſedneſs, wherewith the God of the man Jeſus ſhould bleſs Chriſtians, he cryes out in the 2 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>Why do the heathen Rage, and the people ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a vain thing?</hi> Their great deſign was to keep the people of God from thoſe Bleſſings that God had deſigned by promiſe to give to them, There they were imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſulting, and there they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning well; but obſerve it that very thing, that they thought would be the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their deſignes, tending to this purpoſe, was the greateſt in-let to all theſe Bleſſings. Certainly they were in great Joy, and had much ſatisfaction upon their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, when they got Chriſt nailed upon the Croſs, but their very nailing and crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, made way for all theſe Bleſſings; It opened as it were all the treaſures of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:133178:50"/>grace, it opened all the Relations that were diſcovered; and the Bleſſings upon the death of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt came flowing out of the promiſes, and flowing out of Relations, and the World was filled with theſe Bleſſings: So that I ſay whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deviſes the World hath, to interpoſe between Chriſtians and their Bleſſings, they will be in vain, if they take up one conduit; God will lay many more; And if they give an obſtruction one way, he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed other waies and manage it. It is the God of Jeſus Chriſt that hath bleſſed Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and therefore Chriſtians have their Bleſſings ſure.</p>

Why, my friends, here lay the caſe, O, ſaies thy conſcience, thou never comeſt to the word of God but thou deſpiſeſt the God of the word, and thy heart is ſhut againſt the word, even from thy Child-hood, and in thy Child-hood, the Devil ſhuts up thy heart
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:133178:51"/>and the World ſhuts up thy heart, and thy corruptions ſhut up thy heart; but whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is that ſhuts up thy heart, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is that gives being to any diſoblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou art guilty of, be not diſcouraged, though thou canſt not go to him for a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as thy God, becauſe thy conſcience tell thee that thou haſt ſinned againſt thy God, yet thou mayſt go to him at that time as Chriſts God; for God, as the God of Chriſt Jeſus, hath Bleſſed thee with all Spiritual Bleſſings. Therefore, Chriſtians, under all your diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, that ariſe from the ſenſe of your own unworthineſs, let this be your way, to look upon God as the God of Chriſt, and go to God for Bleſſings, as the God of Chriſt.</p>

But let me tell you, Sirs, a great many things of this nature, if they be brought to the Teſt, will not be found to be Spiritual Bleſſings; Why? Becauſe the tendency of theſe Bleſſings is not to conform you to the God of Chriſt Jeſus? Do you find your

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:133178:55"/>of, one whom private Chriſtians diſregard; yet God ſpys a little grace in him: We it may be are ready to think it would be no great matter to loſe ſuch a little grain as this; no great matter if the Devil ſhould hurry ſuch a one into ſuch ſins; no great matter if that afflictions ſweep away and ſuch a Profeſſour, from the Ordinances and from communion &amp; fellowſhip with God in his own appointments. But, my Friends, here is the Caſe; The Lord he obſerveth what there is within, and the Lord doth not act nor carry it either under general or particular judgments, according to our obſervation or ſenſe, but according to his own obſervation and the truth of the thing: If there be grace, though it be in the leaſt degree; if there be grace though under very great diſadvantages and under great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, yet an all-ſearching Eye can eſpy a grain of Corn in a heap of Chaff. It may be there is a great deal of Chaff, a great deal of vanity, a great deal of earthlineſs, which do not commend thee before men, but rather diſcommend thee before God and man, but little grace in thy life, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in thy prayers, little in thy heart, little in thy underſtanding; Ay, But if God eſpy <hi>a little grace</hi> under all this Rubbiſh, <hi>a little grain,</hi> a grain of the leaſt ſize under all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:133178:55"/>this Heap of Chaff and Rubbiſh. The Lord will take care of this. <hi>Yet,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>ſhall not the leaſt grain fall to the ground.</hi>

                  <hi>A little grace, though never ſo little, is diſtinguiſhing grace as well as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, though never ſo much:</hi> When the Lord did at firſt work the work of grace upon thy heart, then he made a perſonal diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thee and others; and it is not the muchneſs of thy grace that gives the eſſential diſtinction, but it is the truth of thy grace that diſtinguiſheth thee from others. I will open this in theſe 2 Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt. <hi>The leaſt degree, or the leaſt grain, of grace is the Iſſue of Gods eternal diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindneſs.</hi> God from all eternity, before the foundations of the world were laid, did elect and chooſe thee to receive ſuch a meaſure of grace in ſuch a little proportion, as well as another in a large meaſure and in a greater proportion; <hi>ye are choſen in him,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>before the Foundation of the World was laid, that ye ſhould be Holy.</hi> God did not only chooſe thoſe that were inriched with more then ordinary Grace, thoſe that are full of the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:133178:56"/>Holy-Ghoſt, were not the only Perſons that were in the Eye &amp; upon the Heart of God from all Eternity, but thoſe that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, though but their meaſures by ſcantling. Theſe are the Perſons that God did from all Eternity deſign, by this little grace, to make a perſonal difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and others; Let me tell you all the moraliſts in the World, and all the great ones of the World, have not ſo much as this little grace amounts to; Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten thouſands of hearts, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Throne, and not a grain of grace in them, &amp; therefore, my Friends if ſo then, this muſt needs be clear, that either God muſt look after this little grace or muſt loſe the reſolve of his Eternal Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That this little hath the nature of the whole,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt compares the Kingdom of Heaven in hearts unto <hi>a grain of muſt and Seed, which is the leaſt of all grains.</hi> Why though it be ſo little, yet there is a proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, or a ſeminal vertue and power, in that little. The leaſt grain of Corn is wheat it hath the Nature of wheat, as well as the fulleſt, ſo the leaſt Chriſtian, he that hath the leaſt grace, hath the whole nature of Chriſtianity, as well as he that hath moſt <hi>who deſpiſeth the day of ſmall things?</hi> Though you do, yet God will not; it may be you
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:133178:56"/>take little notice, and ſay, it is but a little, but yet in this little is the nature of the whole: If there be true faith, though it be little, yet here is all the truth of faith in a little faith, and there is all the Truth of love, the whole nature of love, in a little love; and there is the whole nature of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, though it be ſhut up as it were in a little compaſs; &amp; if it be ſo then this little muſt be and is the care of God, becauſe the leaſt grain hath the nature of the whole, and ſo here is the whole nature of grace even in the leaſt grace. Therefore, ſays God, the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> this perverſe, this rebelliuos houſe, this is a frothy and chaffy houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet I will not loſe the leaſt grain, yet <hi>not the leaſt grain ſhall fall upon the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the leaſt grace is under deſignments of grace as well as the greateſt:</hi> Nay let me tell you, Sirs, There are many Chriſtians that have moſt at firſt conſidering the proportion, &amp; there are, on the other hand, many Chriſtians who have leaſt at firſt, and yet afterwards do attain to a great deal more then thoſe that had moſt at firſt. God doth not always do as we do, or as man doth. Many times to him that hath moſt at firſt there is many times moſt given afterwards; but God doth not always do ſo but he gives
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:133178:57"/>ſometimes the greateſt encreaſe an encreaſe like the encreaſes of God, even unto thoſe in whom at firſt he did Create but little. One could hardly perceive the flax ſmoaking the other day, and now it is all on a flame; and take another Chriſtian, &amp; as ſoon as ever the fire is put into the flax, the flax fell all into a ſmoak. There was a great appearance, a great heat at firſt, but take him three, or four, or five, years after, &amp; behold a damp again; the man had great incomes at firſt, but afterwards there was as great an abatement, &amp; he that had leaſt now hath moſt ſo that I ſay, conſidering the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the deſignment, the unlimited deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that relate to thoſe that have little, may give a reaſon why the Lord will look after the leaſt grace, why ſpecial grace will be charged with the preſervation &amp; ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the leaſt. Satan may ſuggeſt, why what is this, a poor thing that can hardly crawl towards Chriſt in a duty; ſo weak, there is little or nothing to be ſeen of the Image of God in his heart, becauſe there is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Ay but, Chriſtians, you do not know un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what deſignment this little is, what great things the Lord hath to manage by this little grace, <hi>Daniel,</hi> when the Lord ſhewed him the great revolutions that were to be in the world, he ſhewed him <hi>a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:133178:57"/>Mountain,</hi> a mighty mountain; And he ſhewed him alſo <hi>a little Stone, that was cut out of the Mountain without hands,</hi> and this ſtone ſhould be bigger than the Mountain. The Mountain, if you take it to be the Roman Empire, that was as a Mountain that filled a great part of the Earth; ay but the little Stone, that is cut out of the Mountain without hands, that ſhall cover all the face of the Earth in its time. So I ſay do but you make it your buſineſs to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grace, and never preſcribe any limits as to that grace; A little grace may be under a great deſign; little <hi>David</hi> did more then the mighty man <hi>Saul</hi> that was taller than all the Iſraelites, he was under a greater deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I pray conſider this with me under theſe two branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The leaſt grace may be under a deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for greateſt ſervice for the time to come:</hi> Chriſt is Prophecied of, as a root that ſhould grow out of a dry ground, ſo Chriſt is compared, he promiſed but little, there was but a very ſlender appearance of Jeſus at the firſt, that ever he ſhould be the man in whom all the Promiſes and Prophecies ſhould center. A Carpenters Son, this is but the Son of a Carpenter, ſay they, an unlikely thing, that all the Promiſes and Prophecies of the Meſſiah ſhould center
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:133178:58"/>in him, and have their accompliſhment in him: Even ſo it may be with Chriſtians, little beginnings many times do work and boil up, and improve unto greateſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takements. If you nakedly conſider how the Lord dealt with his own Diſciples, one would wonder that they ſhould be his hearers, three years and and an half, and, when all came to all, had not ſo much Faith, as to believe that this was really he; that they ſhould not have grace enough to bear them out in one bruſh of trial, that they met with, in the apprehending of our Lord, but they muſt all forſake him, when he was upon the Croſs. That indeed was ſomething a great trial, but to forſake him as ſoon as ever he was apprehended, and for <hi>Peter</hi> to deny him as ſoon as ever he was challenged, this do's not diſcover greatneſs of grace. Truly theſe men, as I may ſay, were men of little ſtature, and the Kingdom of Heaven in them, during that time they lived with Chriſt and heard the Lord Chriſt, was but as a grain of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard Seed; and yet theſe were the men that muſt do the great work of God in the World. So it may be there is but a little grace in thy Childs Heart, or in thine own Heart, but that little grace may be under a great deſignment for great ſervice,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:133178:58"/>and therefore it is that the Lord will look after a little, becauſe he knows what it is that you are deſigned for, and that every one is deſigned for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The leaſt grace may be under a deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the greateſt injoyments;</hi> that is, God may deſign a Perſon for the greateſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that hath now but the leaſt grace, Many times Children, that are weakeſt, have moſt of the manifeſtations of the tender affections of the Mother. Truly ſo I may ſay the Lord doth lead thoſe many times by the hand, that he hath given but little grace to, when others are as it were turned to go of themſelves; the Lambs are carried in the Boſom of the Shepherd. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. the Lord promiſeth that <hi>he will raiſe up a Shepherd, that ſhall gather the Lambs with his arm, and carry them in his Boſom.</hi> Chriſtians, though you be but little, yet I Pray conſider, you may be under a deſignment of great enjoyments; the Lord doth many times give you, as it were, the ſweet of the Goſpel, whilſt he feeds others with courſer and harſher fare. The Lord giveth you the dainties of the Covenant, and of the Promiſes, when he doth treat with others with more courſe or more common Providences. Chriſtians, I pray conſider not only for the preſent but for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:133178:59"/>the time to come, you may be under the greateſt deſignments, for the greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; and therefore it is that God will not loſe the leaſt grain: what ſieve ſoever he makes uſe of, to be ſure his Eye and his Hand will be upon the leaſt grain in the ſieve, becauſe of their deſignment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Lord will take care of thoſe that have the leaſt grace, becauſe thoſe that have the leaſt grace have a full right.</hi> I pray do but obſerve, there is no gradual difference in Goſpel right; if I have a right to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate wrapt up in a ſcroul of paper, it is as much as the right that another hath to his Eſtate that is written or enlarged upon in a ſheet: truly ſo it is with Chriſtians, little grace gives a full right, and therefore the Lord will look after it; or elſe he muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his own right to be loſt, the right that he hath given to be void, if he doth not look after the leaſt grace. I will open this in theſe two Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The greateſt promiſes are made to the leaſt of graces:</hi> I pray turn to that paſſage of our Lord in the firſt Sermon that ever he preached upon the Mount, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> ſay he, <hi>are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> What can you have more than the Kingdom, not the Kingdoms of the Earth, but the Kingdom
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:133178:59"/>of Heaven and the Kingdom without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation: Theirs is the throne of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and their is the Crown of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, &amp; theirs is the Bleſſedneſs &amp; the glory of the Kingdom; and who are theſe to whom this Kingdom in all its glory is thus annexed by promiſe? It is thoſe <hi>who are poor in Spirit,</hi> that have but a little grace, and yet are ſenſible of their little. Chriſtians, there is no graduall variation in right, though there are always gradual variations in the comfort of your right; you ſhall ſcarce meet with two Chriſtians that have in all points an equal ballance of comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enjoyment of their Right; and yet their Right is the ſame, thy promiſe is my promiſe, and the Bleſſing that is a Chriſtians by Covenant, that hath attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the greateſt meaſures of grace, theſe very Bleſſings, and this very Covenant, may with all its Bleſſings belong to him that hath leaſt grace. May a man that is well thriven in grace, ſay <hi>all this is mine,</hi> as God ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he led him forth, come, ſaies he, look towards the Eaſt, and the Weſt, and the North and the South, <hi>Behold all this Land will I give thee.</hi> So I may ſay to a Chriſtian, Chriſtian, come look from the one end of the Scripture to the other, look upwards, look downwards, look on this hand, and look on the other
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:133178:60"/>hand from the Eaſt to the Weſt, from the North to the South, <hi>Behold all this God hath given thee.</hi> Ay but I am poor, ſaies the Chriſtian; it is no matter, thy poverty doth not deſtroy thy right? thy Poverty makes no alteration in thy right: do not ſay in thy Heart, this is for thoſe that are tall Cedars, this is for thoſe that are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but as for me, alas I am not, well if there be but a little, though never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, thy right is the ſame; a little grace you ſee doth give right to the greateſt bleſſings, and the greateſt bleſſings are eſtabliſhed upon the leaſt grace; <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> There is nothing in the Kingdom, but what is theirs that are poor in Spirit, that have but little, and are ſenſible that they have but a little: though they have but a little, yet bleſſed are the poor, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſame grace that gives the right makes the difference, the gradual difference:</hi> Though there be a gradual difference in the receipt, yet it is the ſame grace: It may be the Lord hath given thee five Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, it may be to another he hath given but two, and it may be he hath given to another but one Talent; well but yet I ſay it is the ſame grace that gives all thoſe Talents, and that gives a like right with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:133178:60"/>thoſe various or diſproportioned gifts, it is the ſame grace, all iſſue from the ſame Fountain, and therefore it is, that the leaſt grace will be looked after: He that gave thee a right to five Talents, gave thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as good and as equal a right to one, he that gave thy Neighbour a Poſſeſſion of a great meaſure of grace, and thereby, it may be, his right is more manifeſted, it was the ſame grace that gave thee the Poſſeſſion of a little grace; and yet thy right is as ſubſtantial and true, becauſe the grace, that giveth grace, differenceth in its giving, and yet gives the ſame right under theſe different gifts.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The leaſt grace diſcovers an intereſt in the greateſt relations, as well, as the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of grace do's.</hi> Where there is a great deal of grace, you ſay, ſurely this is a Child of God. Ay, and there is one that hath but a grain of grace, that is as ſurely the Child of God, as he that hath more, he is as ſurely born of God, as he that hath the greateſt degree of grace, here is one that, it may be, can fill a Prayer with grace, and here is another that hath hardly grace e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſtock a few Petitions, or it may be he hath grace to ſtock a Confeſſion or two, and he puts forth that little grace, that he hath in his Confeſſion or Petitions,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:133178:61"/>what then; I tell you, God will take care of the one as well as of the other, <hi>the leaſt grain ſhall not fall to the ground,</hi> becauſe the leaſt grain gives a diſcovery of an intereſt in the greateſt relations; thou ſayeſt ſurely this is a Man of God, why? O he hath a great deal of grace, and I ſay as ſurely, that poor man is a Man of God, why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath a little grace. A Member of Jeſus Chriſt is that man whoſe grace is flouriſhing, Ay, and that man is alſo a Member of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe grace lies under the aſhes, there are no Flamings forth as yet, Ay but, my Friends, there is a ſpark under the Embers: I ſhall likewiſe open this in theſe two Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is this, <hi>Greateſt relations do not depend upon the proportions of the graces of the relations,</hi> nay let me tell you, that thoſe relations, that do diſcover the greateſt intimacy, and bring a Man within the greateſt Bleſſedneſs, theſe do not depend or hang upon the proportion of the graces of thoſe relations. O, ſayes the Spouſe in the Concluſion of the Book of Canticles, <hi>O that thou wert as my Brother, that ſucked the Breaſts of my Mother.</hi> 8. <hi>Cant. v.</hi> 1. So I may ſay, it is many times with the Lords People, they cry out, O that Jeſus Chriſt would reveal himſelf to me, O he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:133178:61"/>diſcovers himſelf to ſuch and ſuch, O that he were as my Brother! I dare not call him my Brother, Ay, but though thou dareſt not call him thy Brother, thou canſt humbly hope that thou art his Servant, though thou canſt not with that Freedom and fulneſs of aſſurance, call him thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; O that he were as my Brother as one that ſucked the Breaſts of my Mother! O that I were but in full communion with him! Well it may be thou art not yet in that fulneſs of Freedom of Spirit, that thou canſt not as yet call him thy Brother, yet thou mayſt do ſo, though thou haſt but little grace: Relations do not bear propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the proportion of the graces of the related, and therefore it is, that God will look after the leaſt grain of grace, becauſe the leaſt is his. It is my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grain of Corn, this is my little grace, this is my little Faith, and my little Love, and this is my little meekneſs; the leaſt degree of grace doth diſcover an intereſt in the greateſt relations, and greatneſs of relation, doth not bear proportion to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of enjoyment.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, <hi>That thoſe relations that a Chriſtian ſtands in unto God, immediately up-his entring into the relation, all the bleſſings of the relation lye before him:</hi> Now the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:133178:62"/>leaſt degree of grace doth admit to the Relation; and now being admitted, all the bleſſedneſs, all the glory, all the ſweetneſs, all the comfort, all the happineſs of the Relation, lye before this man, as well as before him that hath the greateſt degree of grace. You will ſay, what is the glory of the Relation? Nay what glory is there that is not in any relation that belongs to the Goſpel? In every Goſpel Relation there is a fulneſs of glory, and a fulneſs of Bleſſedneſs. Now, no ſooner is a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture admitted into the Relation, but all the bleſſedneſs of the Relation ly's open before him; And the leaſt degree of grace admits into the Relation. The Lord doth not deal with his people that are related to him as we do, firſt bring him into one Relation, and then into another Relation, and then into a higher Relation, and then into a nearer Relation. As now many times men bring one firſt into their Family, take him up it may be by the high way, or a neighbours Child, and make him a poor and mean Servant in the Family, it may be, a Scullion, or the like; and then take him up to a higher place, after that to a higher place, till at length he come to make him his Child, and not only his Child, but his heir: But now I pray friends conſider, God,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:133178:62"/>doth not deal ſo with his people, but he takes them into all Relations at one and the ſame time. A Chriſtian, that hath the leaſt degree of grace, ſtands in the higheſt Relations to God: God doth not make him firſt a Servant, and then a Steward, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards adopt him, and afterward ſtate all his Glory and Kingdom upon him; but at one and the ſame time, when grace is firſt wrought, then all the Relations of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel lye open together to the leaſt degree of grace: <hi>If a Son then an Heir.</hi> The Apoſtle concludes that, and that is right Goſpel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, and that upon the leaſt degree of grace; if a Servant, then a Friend; if a Friend then a Son; and if a Son, then an Heir, a joint Heir with Jeſus Chriſt. Goſpel Relations bear not proportion to the graces of the Relation, they are not more or leſs as grace in us is more or leſs; No but one manat the ſame time, that hath theleaſt degree of grace, all the Relations of the Goſpel lye open before him. Though you have not as much grace as others, yet there are as many Relations, and as great Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between God and you, as others, yea as there are between God and the beſt Chriſtian in the world; and, let me tell you, the meaneſt Chriſtian in our days hath all the Relations of the Goſpel, lying open to him, as well as the beſt Diſciples that ever
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:133178:63"/>Jeſus Chriſt had either in or after his daies; and if ſo, my friends, then no wonder why God is ſo concerned about a little grace, <hi>Yet,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>ſhall not the leaſt grain fall upon the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The leaſt degree of grace bears an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial likeneſs to Chriſt, as well as the greateſt degree of grace doth.</hi> I ſay there is an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential reſemblance in the leaſt degree of grace unto Chriſt as well as in the greateſt; every ſpark of fire is true fire as well as the greateſt fire in your Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. I tell you, Chriſtians, the leaſt grace is Chriſt within you, there is the whole Image of Chriſt, there is the love of Chriſt, and there is the holineſs of Chriſt, and there is the meekneſs of Chriſt, and there is the lowlineſs of Chriſt; there is in that little an Eſſential Reſemblance of Chriſt, therefore no wonder that God takes ſo much care for and about a little grace</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Appl. </seg>
                  </label> Is it ſo, That for theſe reaſons God doth look after the leaſt grace in the leaſt Chriſtian, <hi>Then O do you make much of a little duty;</hi> God makes a great account of a little grace, do you make a great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a little duty. If you have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle breathings of heart after God and Chriſt, Jeſus in your heart, do not deny it, do not ſay, It is not likely that theſe ſhould be
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:133178:63"/>regarded; why? becauſe they are but ſome weak faint breathings: You ſee that God looks after a little grace in your hearts and maketh a great account of it; Therefore, I beſeech you, having received a little from God make you great account of that little. I will but urge this with theſe two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seeing God makes a great account of that little that thou haſt, Let me only ask you this Queſtion, <hi>Whether it be not better for you to follow the example of God, than to follow the Devils example?</hi> The devil would have you to make nothing of a little, God and Jeſus Chriſt would have you to make great account of a little; <hi>Satans</hi> deſign is, when he cannot hinder the work, to ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clypſe the glory of the work that is wrought, and to abate and allay the beauty of the work that is wrought, that is <hi>Satans</hi> buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſign. I pray, friends, conſider, you hear it is Gods way to make much of a little, Now, whether will you fall in with God or with <hi>Satan?</hi> He would make little of a great deal of grace, yea he would make nothing of it; but God he makes a great deal of a little grace. O, Sirs, do you therefore in imitation of God &amp; Chriſt Jeſus, do you alſo make much of it; you ſee God hath made ſo much of it that he hath made it the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:133178:64"/>peculiar, ſpecial matter of a diſtinguiſhing promiſe; well, ſays he, though I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and ſift the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and I will turn them out of one ſieve into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet, ſaies he, <hi>ſhall not the leaſt grain fall to the earth.</hi> I will not loſe the leaſt grain, no not for all the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> for all the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi> no not for all the Devils in Hell, I will not loſe the leaſt grain. God hath other manner of thoughts of the leaſt work of grace thou haſt, than I am perſwaded moſt Chriſtians have of the greateſt works of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Truly you do not know how ſoon this little may grow up to a great deal.</hi> It is the hypotheſis of our Lords arguing, ſays he, ſince thou haſt not been faithful in a little, who will truſt thee with more? So I ſay, on the other hand, if thou beeſt faithful with a little, if thou admire the condeſcenſion of the grace of God, to work a little grace in thy heart, how doſt thou know but God may the next Sermon work a great deal more? Jeſus Chriſt may come the next op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity with a full hand, and empty his hand into thy heart; thou doſt not know how ſoon this little may be made a great deal. If you be faithful in the improvement of a little, if you be thankful for a little, if you do make great account, as God doth,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:133178:64"/>of a little, then grace will ſoon add more, You know not how ſuddenly you may be ſurpriſed with more. I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that one great reaſon why men grow no more in grace, is, becauſe they deſpiſe their little ſo much: One great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why God gives no more grace is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſpiſe their little grace ſo much. Chriſtians, I beſeech you, if you have but a little, O make great account of that little, if there be but a grain; It is one of Gods grains caſt in by Jeſus Chriſt and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus Chriſt, into thy heart, make much of it, becauſe thou doeſt not know how ſoon more may come, Says Chriſt, Take the Talent from him that did not uſe it; &amp; give it to him that had five even ſo the Lord may come and ſay, here is a poor creature, his heart leapt within him for Joy becauſe I have given him a little grace, this Soul is always bleſſing me for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I will give him more. Truly, Chriſtians, a high eſteem of a little grace is much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the beſt Chriſtians; if God hath given you but a little, I am ſure that little is more than you deſerve; the ſmalleſt things of the Goſpel, ſhould be ſpent with a cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, grace. Therefore my friends in obſervance of God, and in imitation of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I pray ſet your eye and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:133178:65"/>your heart upon that little, let there be a great value and eſteem put upon your lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grace, becauſe you ſee here the Lord doth make it the matter of a ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: Under all ſhakings, when great ſtorms are up, and when wrath hath hold of the the Sieve &amp; ſhakes it in the hand of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or of the malicious <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> when the wrath of God ſhakes the Sieve, then the heart of God is upon the leaſt grain, and the hand of God will never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the leaſt grain to fall. <hi>For Lo,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I will command and ſift the houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the ſieve of the Nations, as Corn is ſifted in a ſieve, yet ſhall not the leaſt Grain fall upon the Earth.</hi>

               <p>THE dependance of this Subject upon my former Diſcourſes, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of it in the ſame general deſign, I cleared in the morning. As an Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this Evenings Diſcourſe, I would only obſerve theſe two things from the Context to you; and the firſt is, That it is a gracious Promiſe, ſucceeding the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuleſt threatnings; <hi>Iſrael</hi> had offended, and the Lord of <hi>Iſrael</hi> takes to the offence; and therefore in a more than ordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the whole concern of the threatning is uſher'd in by the Prophet, in <hi>verſe</hi> 1. <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Lord ſtanding upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> and he ſays, <hi>Smite the Lintel, ſmite the Lintel of the door, that the poſts may ſhake;</hi> a concuſſion, a ſhaking of the Inſtitutions, and the Ordinances of the Temple, ſeems
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:133178:66"/>to uſher in this Prophecy; and what the ſmiting of the Lintel of the door that the Prophet obſerves is, you may ſee in the ſucceeding verſes; and the Lord's reſolve is, to take them, however they did attempt to ſecure themſelves from him; though they dig into Hell, thence ſhall my hand take them; though they climb up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I will bring them down. Sirs, <hi>There's no eſcaping of the hand of God, when once the Lord ſtands upon the Altar, and commands the Lintel of the door to be ſmitten;</hi> he gives the reaſon and the account of that in the next verſes; I ſhall not intermeddle with them; but yet, notwithſtanding all that he had threatned againſt his People, he comes in with this promiſe; <hi>Yet</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſhall not the leaſt grain fall upon the Earth. I the Lord</hi> (ſays he) <hi>will command, and I will ſift the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and it ſhall be with the Sieve of the Nations that hate the houſe of</hi> Iſrael. Lord (might <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſay) here's nothing but deſolation; yea, (ſays God) look to it; yet of all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſifting the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> I will look after the grain; <hi>there ſhall not one grain fall to the ground,</hi> no not the leaſt.</p>
               <p>Another thing I would obſerve, That this ſeems to have an aſpect upon Goſpel-times: <hi>Lo,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I will command,</hi> and yet
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:133178:66"/>
                  <hi>ſhall not the leaſt grain fall to the ground.</hi> Waving other conſiderations, I will only obſerve this one thing, That it is at that time, when God will raiſe up the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of <hi>David;</hi> God throws his People by ſhovel-fulls as it were, into the Sieve of the Nations: It is not the Chaff, but the Corn that the Nations envy: It is not thoſe that are formal and ſuperſtitious Profeſſors, but the ſerious practical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that are the hated; yet (ſays God) as to them, there ſhall not a grain fall to the Earth; and I ground this Obſervation upon a paſſage in the 11th <hi>verſe. In that day</hi> (ſays he) <hi>will I raiſe up the Tabernacle of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>that is fallen.</hi> When will God ſhew this diſtinguiſhing kindneſs? and when will God glorifie himſelf in fulfilling the Promiſe? in that day when God will raiſe up the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> that is fallen, and cloſe up the breaches; in that day. I pray you turn to <hi>Acts</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 16. and there you ſhall ſee, <hi>James</hi> he is there vindicating ſome practices of <hi>Peter,</hi> in going to, and alſo in communicating with the Gentiles; <hi>Simon</hi> (ſays he) hath declared, how that God did at firſt viſit the Gentiles: And to this agree the words of the Prophet; <hi>Afterward I will return, and build the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of</hi> David <hi>that is fallen:</hi> So that here
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:133178:67"/>is an Old-Teſtament Promiſe fulfill'd, not only upon the Jews, but upon the Gentiles. I have not time to open the myſtery that is compris'd in that, only I think it is the Goſpel-Government of Chriſt; and at that time will the Lord take eſpecial care of the leaſt grain, that it ſhall not fall upon the Earth: Though he commands, and though he ſifts the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Spirit in the Sieve of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>yet then ſhall not the leaſt grain fall to the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſeems to me to be the true import of the Context; and I hope theſe Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations will make way for the Application of what I have delivered, and what I ſhall deliver to be the Caſes of Chriſtians, and the Caſe of the Church of Chriſt in all their circumſtances.</p>
               <p>That which I laid as the foundation of the whole Diſcourſe was this, <hi>That even in the worſt of times, God will take eſpecial care of the leaſt of Chriſtians.</hi> The meaneſt Chriſtians are the eſpecial care, and the charge of God, and Chriſt, when the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Chriſtians are expoſed to the greateſt danger: Says God, <hi>I will command, and I will ſift,</hi> Why, <hi>yet ſhall not the leaſt grain fall to the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divers Reaſons I gave you, the fifth was this;</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:133178:67"/>
               <p n="5">V. That the Lord will take ſpecial care of the meaneſt Chriſtians in the hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſeſt times, becauſe, the meaneſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath the perfect Image of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; there is not indeed the perfection of degrees, yet there is a perfect Image; they are not come to their pitch of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, yet they have all attained unto their eſſential being of their Chriſtianity; every little Grace is a full repreſentative of Chriſt; the leaſt grain of Wheat is truly Wheat, as well as the fulleſt, and the moſt pregnant grain is; there is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, and the nature of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, in the meaneſt Chriſtian that breaths upon the face of the Earth, (as he was in the form of a Servant) and I pray obſerve, that the expreſs Image of his Fathers glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (as you have it) <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>The brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon</hi> was upon him; Who is this? why the Man Jeſus, he that was the Lord's Servant, and the Servant to Rulers, and that took upon him the form of a Servant; he at that time was the expreſs Image of his Perſon, the brightneſs of his Glory; truly, my Friends, ſo I may ſay, take a poor Chriſtian under the greateſt diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſuppoſe driven into the Wilderneſs, tempted of the Devil, you may look on
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:133178:68"/>him and ſay, There goes one that is the expreſs Image of Jeſus Chriſt, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that hath divers temptations and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions ſurrounding him, you may ſay, there lies one upon his Bed, there ſits ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Corner, that is the expreſs Image of Jeſus; Ay but he hath but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grace; well, the whole Image of Chriſt is in that little. Thoſe that are well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in drawing and limning, they can as well in a little compaſs draw the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Effigies, as they can in a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. Truly my Friends, though your limbs be not ſo big (as I may ſay) though your countenances be not ſo big, your graces be not ſo big, yet here's a true repreſentation of Chriſt; where's the leaſt grace there's a full and expreſs Image of the Perſon of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore the Lord will take care, becauſe of the Image. Says Chriſt, when they brought him by an enſnaring queſtion, to give them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, why <hi>ſhew me the penny, whoſe is the Image?</hi> So my Friends, if you bring your own hearts to the Lord, the Lord will ask the queſtion, Whoſe Image, whoſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription is it? and will anſwer himſelf, it is my own; it is my own Superſcription and Image, though it be in ſo ſmall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. Chriſtians, I would have you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:133178:68"/>that God and Chriſt have great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for things without proportion; though you have not ſo much Faith, nor ſo much Love, nor ſo much Humility, yet if you have true Faith, true Love, true Humility, God and Chriſt will know his own; God will know his own Image, though drawn in the leaſt compaſs. I will open this in theſe two branches. that I might make manifeſt the rationality of this proceed of the Lord; and the firſt is this;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is no part of the Image of Chriſt in any heart, but that does diſcover the whole Image to be really and indeed in the heart.</hi> And my reaſon is, becauſe God creates nothing imperfectly neither in the New, nor in the Old Creation, nothing imperfectly; he takes <hi>Adam's</hi> Rib out of his ſide, and he makes a perfect Image, and repreſentation of that; and he takes up Clay or Red Earth, and he makes a perfect man of that. Truly Chriſtians, let me tell you, that all monſtruous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are the iſſues (either on the one hand or the other) of the degeneracy, and not the products of the Creation. So here, where God hath created the likeneſs of Chriſt, in love there is (you may conclude) the likeneſs of Chriſt in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:133178:69"/>all other Excellencies; the Lord does not uſe to turn the new Creatures out of his hand by peece-meal, or by parts, now a little, and then a little, but the whole is where there is an eſſential part; You ſhall find all along, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt owning theſe principles in his carriage towards his Diſciples, and towards them with whom he did converſe; you can hardly diſcover, in his own diſciples, ſo much (while he lived) as to make up a diſtinct intire Chriſtian as to parts in equal proportion, and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing though Chriſt obſerved it, yet you ſhall find he owned them as his own, and called them his own, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. <hi>Having loved his own, he loved them to the end.</hi> What think you? Was <hi>Peter</hi> like Chriſt? And did he expreſs any thing of the Image of Chriſt? when he knew that his Lord could have commanded Angels for his ſecurity, yet he truckles at the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſilly Girl.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That little grace that is in us, does diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a whole right to all Chriſt, and to all the Conſequences of every thing, that in any Capacity Jeſus Chriſt did or ſuffered.</hi> God does not ſtand with Chriſtians (as I may ſay) upon ſuch punctilioes as one Chriſtian ſtands with another upon; God
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:133178:69"/>is wiſe, and knows that any thing of his Son, is a Goſpel-evidence of full right; And therefore it is becauſe of his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Lord will look after and concern himſelf in the leaſt grain. And that is the fifth reaſon.</p>
               <p>I will but add one more, for I would not prevent my ſelf in the Application, and that is this.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. <hi>The leaſt grain of grace is as really and as truly, new-covenant grace, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt degree of grace is, or can be ſuppoſed to be.</hi> Or if you will, the leaſt Chriſtian that hath but true grace, is as really a New-Covenant Chriſtian, as he that hath moſt grace, and therefore God will look after him; When he is ſifting <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the ſieve of the Nations, he will look after the grain.</p>
               <p>I pray do but obſerve theſe two things for the clearing of this;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>When the Lord Covenants to write his Laws, he does not covenant to write them all in the ſame proportion, in all hearts in the ſame proportion;</hi> But this is the Covenant, <hi>I will write my Laws;</hi> and the proportion that is to be written, in the hearts of the Sons, and Daughters of men, is left to his pleaſure to be done. Many are ready to queſtion that little they have, becauſe they have not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:133178:70"/>ſo much as another; pray, when did God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf to proportion thy grace to thy Brothers? yet though it be in a leſſer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, it is as truly New-Covenant writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the writing of a greater. Do but turn if you pleaſe to that paſſage in the New Teſtament, Heb. 8. ver. 8. <hi>Behold the dayes come that I will make a New Covenant, with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Houſe of</hi> Judah; <hi>not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers.</hi> &amp;c. But ver. 10. <hi>I will put my Laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts.</hi> Hath every one the ſame proportion of Goſpel-knowledge in their head? No, they have not, yet every one hath a ſaving proportion. So as to grace in the heart, you ſhall find there is a difference in the proportion, though not in the nature of the thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned; <hi>I will write my Laws in their hearts.</hi> Here's enough. And when a New-Covenant promiſe hath taken place in the heart, the dreadfulleſt Old-Covenant threatning hath nothing to do there. It may be he hath written but ſome rough Character in thy heart, at the preſent, why that is enough to exempt thee from all the Old Covenant proceeds, and to give thee right to all the New-Covenant Bleſſings; and if you cannot ſee it ſo well, God I am ſure can.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:133178:70"/>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>But the leaſt grace that God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the heart, hath the moſt Subſtantial promiſes made to it.</hi> I pray Chriſtians, is it not a more Subſtantial promiſe, that you ſhall be eternally filled with joy in the houſe of your Father in the Kingdom of glory, than to be filled with joy while you live here at the footſtool? for my part I think if I ſhould never have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable day while I live, it would be a great happineſs, to have ſecret aſſurance that I ſhall have an eternal day of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs; it may be my condition may be laid open to temptation, and it may be thine, and thou mayeſt be yet tryed with a Tryal that is nearer a fiery Tryal, than any yet thou haſt been laid under; but what then? (Saies the Apoſtle) (that I think had his ſhare in Sufferings,) <hi>Theſe light afflictions work for us a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Now upon this account it is, that God looks after the leaſt grain. I ſhall paſs to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deliver my ſenſe as to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveableneſs of it, in theſe five or ſix practical Concluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> And the firſt is this; Will God in the ſiftings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> take care that the leaſt grain do not fall to the Earth? <hi>Then let every one look upon themſelves as greatly
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:133178:71"/>concerned to be made Gods grains.</hi> My meaning is, <hi>to get grace</hi> though it be never ſo little. <hi>Satan</hi> hath two deſigns by way of dilemma upon you; if you eſcape the one, a thouſand to one, but you fall into the other, and what are theſe deſigns of <hi>Satan?</hi> truly the deſign lyes here; What, ſhouldeſt thou be content with ſo little, when others that have been more ſinful have more? deſpiſe and ſlight the little, becauſe it is not likely thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ever attain to much: and how does he manage it? Thou art old (he ſaies to one) and therefore it is not likely thou ſhouldeſt live long, and therefore canſt not expect to grow; if thou hadſt begun betimes, it had been ſomething like. And to thoſe that are young; all in good time yet: See but ſuch a one, that liv'd a long time in the enjoyment of his pleaſure, and God look't upon him, and ſee how he grew up to a great deal of grace in a little time; here's the dilemma now, between the one and the other. My friends, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you therefore fix upon a little grace. I will open this in two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the midſt of his ſevereſt diſpenſations God will find out a little grace.</hi> It may be you will ſay, will God look upon me? If
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:133178:71"/>I were as <hi>David</hi> (may the poor Soul ſay) and (may another ſay) if I were as the Angel of the Lord, the Lord would find me out; nay, ſtay proud Soul; it is enough if thou beeſt but weak, &amp; let grace take it's own time to make thee as <hi>David,</hi> the weak ſhall be as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>David</hi> as the Angel of the Lord. Friends, I would beg of you, that you would not live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a little grace, and that you would live chearfully with a little grace until God give more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Second is this. <hi>That a little in being is as much as all in reverſion.</hi> Art thou but a ſmall grain? Pray who made thee a ſmall grain? Hath not he alſo the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of the Spirit? Cannot he make the dry Tree to grow out of the dry ground? Cannot he make a little one a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Surely he hath the reſidue of the Spirit. Let me tell you, God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver begins with great things, in the moſt remarkable proceeds of grace that are by paſt, and that are to come; but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes begins with a little, and ſo glorifies both his grace, and his power in making that little greater than all. Therefore pray Sirs, let me perſwade you, you that are young, and you that are old, if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hope for a great deal, give God no reſt, till
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:133178:72"/>he give you a little; till he make you a little Chriſtian; give him no reſt. Oh bring your Children, and cry, Lord, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grace for this Child; Oh bring your Servants, &amp; cry, Lord, a little grace for this Servant; Oh caſt your hearts at the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool of the Throne, and ſay, Lord a little grace for this graceleſs heart, if it be but a little, Lord. As thy Soul liveth (ſaies the Woman to the Prophet) <hi>I have but a little meal in the barrel, and a little oyl in the cruſe;</hi> What then (ſays the Prophet) <hi>come &amp; make me a Cake.</hi> So I ſay my friends, as the Lord liveth, if he hath created a little grace, he will create more; and therefore my Friends, bleſs God for a little, and be not contented without a little.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Will not the Lord ſuffer the leaſt grain to fall to the Earth in all the ſiftings? <hi>Then you may ſee the vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that are between the righteous and the wicked, and that in God's providential pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. I will throw</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael <hi>into the Sieve of the Nations;</hi> and what then? let the Chaff go; let the Chaff go; let the heads that have not grain in them fall to the Earth; Oh (ſays he) but the leaſt grain ſhall not fall to the Earth; you have God's Word for it. The great difference that God makes in his
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:133178:72"/>general Judgments between the righteous and the wicked.</p>
               <p>I will open this in two Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is more that God likes, in the leaſt grain, than there is in heaps of the Chaff of the wicked;</hi> there is more that God likes, in the heart of the pooreſt Chriſtian, than God can diſcover in a whole Nation of Hypocrites put together: No, there is not ſo much as a poor Chriſtian hath, that hath but a little grace; caſt them into the ballance, and they are altogether lighter than vanity. When it came to the pinch indeed, (ſaies God,) I gave <hi>Ethiopia</hi> for thee, and <hi>Seba</hi> for thee; So I tell you my Friends, that God makes no account of the chaff, though it be never ſo bulky; but he makes much of a little grain; the leaſt grain ſhall not fall to the Earth, let the chaff go whither it will; burn it with unquenchable fire (ſaies the Lord) the leaſt grain ſhall not fall away, but the bulky chaff ſhall be burnt with unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That little that a Chriſtian hath, can do more with God, and for God, than all that others have can do.</hi> It may be ſuch a one hath great parts, well, and what does he do for God? and another, he hath a great bulk of gifts, what can he do for God?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:133178:73"/>What can he do? Truly all he can do is only this, to diſſemble with God, and to diſhonour God. The times have been, wherein gifts have been magnified above grace; and not long ſince, by many, but what is come of it? See the providences of God, how they are wheel'd about? And now grace is the only thing that will ſtand us inſtead in our day; and all the gifts that all the profeſſors of <hi>England</hi> had, cannot do ſo much as a little grace: it may be you have a name to live, and profeſs much; but where is your grace? One ſaies, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another I am of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and what then? Where's the Image of Chriſt? you may be of <hi>Paul</hi> while you live, and go to Hell when you die; You may be of <hi>Apollos,</hi> when you are in the Body, and when you die (for ought I know) you may be haled to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Divels in Hell. Such a one, (you ſay) he prayes, he is a mighty man in Prayer; Sirs, I tell you, I value no more my own Prayers, that are Prayers of gifts, and there is no more in them; and God is no more glorified in them, than an empty ſound. But a few ſighs, and groans, ſent up to Heaven, in a way of grace; I tell you this does more for God, and with God, than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:133178:73"/>gifts can do. And if ſo, pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what difference God makes, between the wicked, and the ſeed; obſerve the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> Is it ſo that God will not ſuffer the leaſt grain to fall to the Earth? In theſe, and in ſuch times as theſe? Then I pray Sirs, <hi>Do not truſt your ſelves but God.</hi> There are many that truſt their own graces too much, and the grace of God too little; they think they have grace to keep them. I am ſure it is little ſign of grace, when that grace doth put you off from betruſting the grace of God. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, truſt God more, and your ſelves leſs: alas, what can a little do Chriſtians? I pray lay the ſtreſs of your ſecurity, upon what God hath promiſed. Yet (ſaies God) <hi>there ſhall not the leaſt grain fall to the Earth.</hi> Here is a promiſe of free grace, and there cannot be any thing at all in the grain, to enſue, or to merit this ſecurity: alas Sirs, what is there in our hearts, that hath moſt, that we ſhould talk of ſecuring our ſelves? <hi>Let him that ſtands</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>take heed leſt he fall.</hi> So I may tell you Sirs, our Zeal is no ſecurity, our Faith in it ſelf is no ſufficient ſecurity: but it is the grace of God that made the promiſe, that gives the Chriſtian ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:133178:74"/>in ſuch a time. Such a man was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a while agoe, to turn his back upon Jeſus Chriſt; and he hath bidden farwell to Jeſus Chriſt, and is gone; I pray what ſecurity have you, that you may not be the next? is it your graces that keep you? No, no, it is the grace of God that ſecures you, and the grace of God that keeps you; and therefore I pray lay more ſtreſs upon that, though you lay leſs ſtreſs upon your own.</p>
               <p>I will open this in two Branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Grace that is in you is but a Stream, from the Fountain of Grace that is in God;</hi> And it is but as the drop of a Bucket unto the fulneſs of Grace and Holineſs that is in Chriſt. <hi>Who made me</hi> (ſays <hi>Cain</hi>) <hi>my Brothers keeper?</hi> when God askt him where his Brother <hi>Abel</hi> was: Truly I may ſay to you, God never made your own Graces, the ſole keepers of your own Souls: Who made them? God did not I am ſure; becauſe our own Graces, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Grace of God, can never keep our Souls from the temptations we meet withal; and therefore Sirs, I pray truſt a little more to this God that hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet ſhall not the leaſt grain fall to the Earth; not becauſe it is a grain, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath promiſed, that the leaſt grain ſhall not fall.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:133178:74"/>
               <p>But then, the ſecond thing that I would ſay is this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Your own Graces, that you have in your own hearts, are eaſily ballanced, by the wickedneſs that is in the hearts of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> And I am ſure, they have more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and more power to manage their wickedneſs againſt your Grace, than you have wiſdom, or power to manage your Grace againſt their wickedneſs. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath more wickedneſs in his nature, than you have grace in your nature; it is top-full of wickedneſs; I am ſure your nature is not top-full of grace. <hi>We wreſtle not</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>with fleſh and blood, but with principalities and powers.</hi> Alas, you are neither principality, nor power in your own grace. Do but ballance your ſecurity, and you will eaſily ſee the need of truſting to God, and not to your own grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> Is it ſo, that God hath ſaid, that the leaſt grain ſhall not fall to the Earth? <hi>Oh then, How does it concern every one to know, whether they have a grain of grace or no.</hi> Truly my Friends, I do think it is a matter of very great concernment, that you ſhould be, and we ſhould be all fully ſatisfied in this. The leaſt grain ſhall not fall, ay but an Ear that hath no grain in it
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:133178:75"/>may fall; the leaſt grain ſhall not fall, ay but the Chaff God caſts away; he will throughly purge his floor, and the Chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. Now my Friends, I am not enquiring after your profeſſion of grace, but the grace that is the matter of your profeſſion; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am I going about to diſcover a great deal of grace, full and florid grace, but my buſineſs is to enquire after the leaſt grace, and to diſcover unto you whether you have attained unto that bleſſedneſs, to be one of God's grains, the grain that is here in the Promiſe; though it be one of the leaſt of the grains? I would only ſay this one thing before I deſcend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: Do not ſay you have grace enough, and therefore you are not concerned in the enquiry; I am ſure it is no ſign of a great deal of grace, to be ſhie of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of a little grace; and a great deal of grace may be hid, when God chuſes the diſcovery by a little.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, Oh that I were but one of the leaſt of theſe grains of God! Oh that I were but one of thoſe that God hath ſanctified, though I were the leaſt of all his Saints that he hath ſanctified! Well my Friends, give me leave and I will open this to you in theſe two particulars.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:133178:75"/>Would you know whether you be in the compaſs of the leaſt of theſe grains?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then in the firſt place, I pray <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, how ſtands your hearts affected? how ſtand your hearts affected to more? and to thoſe in whom there is more?</hi> Thoſe that have a natural life, they naturally incline to manifeſt their love, and their natural kindneſs to thoſe that are allied: The Child is naturally inclined to thoſe that are allied; Nature's dictates determine the heart in that caſe; ſo does New Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture incline to the ſame. How ſtands your hearts affected to thoſe that have a great deal of grace? How ſtand you affected to him that hath the Treaſures of all grace? He that hath a little, loves Jeſus Chriſt; he loves Chriſt as the Treaſury of more, though Chriſt at preſent ſuſpends the giving of more; though he ſees but little in his own heart, yet he cannot but love Jeſus Chriſt, that hath the diſpoſe of all. It is one ſign of true grace, that it is alwaies inclined to have more. Now Sirs, open your hearts for this word; How ſtand they affected to Chriſt? How ſtand they affected to ſuch Ordinances, where God does moſt ordinarily work grace? Says God to <hi>Ezekiel, Thou art to this people as a lovely Song;</hi> O poor people!
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:133178:76"/>There are many more pleaſed with the gifts of the Miniſter, than the grace of the Miniſter. Sirs, I pray conſider, How ſtand your hearts affected to grace? He that hath a little, would not loſe a little: A Child tends naturally to have life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and to have more: So I ſay, How ſtand your hearts affected to living Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? a living Mediator? a Mediator that hath all grace? Let me tell you; if you do not love Chriſt as the Treaſury of grace, I ſuſpect your grace; if you do love Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it hath pleaſed the Father that in him all fulneſs of grace ſhould dwell; I do not queſtion your grace; for it is grace to love Chriſt as the Lord Treaſurer of all grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Would you know whether you be one of theſe grains that God takes ſuch ſpecial care about? <hi>Then I pray do but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and conſider with your ſelves, what thing it is that your hearts, and that your affections and minds are moſtly working to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?</hi> My meaning is plainly this; and I will illuſtrate it by this expreſſion; He that hath no grace, can be contented to be what he is, ſo his Conſcience will be quiet; but he that hath a little grace, cannot be content with a ſilent Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without more grace: Many there
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:133178:76"/>are that are greatly concerned about the Peace of their Conſcience; O they do not know what to do! Conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, the Devil ſeems to be let looſe, the Law comes in, Threatnings come in, alas, they know not what to do; riſe up, they have no peace; lie down, they have no peace, under <hi>Job</hi>'s circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, his very Bed was a trouble to him. Now my Friends, my buſineſs is not to enquire, what Conſcience ſays, but what your hearts naturally incline to: Do your hearts naturally incline to more grace? Some there are, can eaſily be ſatisfied, if they do but apprehend they have grace to ſave them; but a heart that hath true grace, though it be never ſo little, though it doth know it hath enough to ſave it, cannot be ſatisfied without it hath more: Now Chriſtians, look to your ſelves; God help you that you may all of you know, whether you be indeed of theſe grains that God hath ſaid ſhall not fall to the Earth.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:133178:77"/>the Lord's Promiſe.

               <p n="1">1.

Now Sirs, have you been kept in an hour of temptation? cry, Grace, grace: Have you been kept in an hour when the Powers of Darkneſs have been toſſing you about? Is there any fire in your hearts ſtill, though the Devil hath been heaping of Aſhes upon you? O admire the riches of God's grace and tenderneſs to you! Says God, <hi>Not one
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:133178:77"/>grain ſhall fall.</hi> Can you find that Love in your hearts, that was ſome years ago? Can you diſcover that Faith, that you had ſome while ſince in the Lord Jeſus ſtill abiding? O Sirs! Admire the Lord who hath ſaid, <hi>Not one grain ſhall fall.</hi> I will tell you one thing (which I think is the deſign of the day) that God is taking his People off from truſting to their own grace, that they might truſt more to, and acknowledge his grace. Alas, what help is in one poor, little, light grain? The Nations they are the Sieves, and there is many a terrible ſhake given; what is the reaſon you are ſtill in the Sieve? O Chriſtians! magnifie grace that your hearts are kept upon God: Magnifie grace that it is not with you, as it is with others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>I pray friends, if you have but a little; be always before the Throne of God for the increaſe of the little.</hi> You have but little grace, and it may be if examined, the leaſt of Gods grains: Bleſſed be God you have a little grace. But I tell you, if God hath kept you all this while, it is for ſome good; Sure it is for ſome good intent; Some good purpoſe: I pray Chriſtians do but conſider with your ſelves; Be not ſatisfied with what you have, but be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

But be exerciſing it for more. <hi>Come make me a Cake</hi> (ſaies the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.) Come Sirs, do you do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with that little for God, and do you improve that little, while you are waiting upon God for more. This ſhould be your carriage. Now Sirs, what ſay your hearts? will they, or will they not? What anſwer muſt I give to God? He tells you, he will keep the leaſt grain, what return ſhall be made to God? Are you willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this, that you will not improve the little? Shall the Lord receive this return from your hearts at this time? I tell you that Jeſus Chriſt is expecting the anſwers of your hearts; and what is the anſwer of your hearts. You ſay to me in your heart, I hope, O what ſhall we do? How ſhall we carry it as becomes thoſe that are kept as the ſmalleſt of Gods graines? Now I tell you, you that are the leaſt, it becomes you to cry mightily to God that you may be more, and that this grain may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with the increaſe of God, even

When the Lord hath accompliſht his work upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> why then he will break the Rod. My friends, do but look upon temptations, and afflictions, you meet withal as means, and methods, that he purge you with; Is there no chaff hangs upon the Corn? I believe there is too much; it may be God hath a mind to ſhake thee out of thy profeſſion, that is, out of confidence in, or lurking under thy profeſſion for ſecurity. Here's a little chaff hangs, and God hath a mind it ſhall be burnt, and it ſticks very cloſe, and God he will give it another ſhake in the Sieve. Why Sirs, let the Lord alone in his own way; He is ſifting; Ay but he will look

Sirs, it is not enough to be with Chriſtians, and to walk with Chriſtians, except you your ſelves be Chriſtians; it is not your being with, or walking with, the Lords People, that can ſecure you from the Lords threatnings. But yet notwithſtanding the dreadfulneſs of the threatning, here is a double reſerve of grace; in the 8. v. he concludes with a reſerve of grace, and indeed it is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of God, in the Old Teſtament, to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:133178:82"/>wind up his dreadful threatnings in the moſt incouraging promiſes of abſolute grace, <hi>ſaving, that I will not utterly deſtroy the Houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſaith the Lord.</hi> I will only obſerve this one thing to you, that whenever you meet with the word <hi>Jacob</hi> in Scripture, you may conclude that the Holy Ghoſt doth intend a diſcovery both of the Politick, and of the Spiritual weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that People, and when you meet with the word <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then it hath relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that name which the Angel of the Lord gave to <hi>Jacob</hi> upon his wreſtling with him, and it doth import the ſtrength of the People; ſaving, ſays he, that I will not utterly deſtroy the Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> though they be never ſo contemptible, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo weak, yet, ſays he, for all my anger, and for all my threatnings, for all my Juſtice and Holineſs; as if he had ſaid, <hi>yet I will not utterly deſtroy the Houſe of</hi> Jacob. The like reſerve of grace you have in the words of the Text, yet ſhall not the leaſt grain fall upon the Earth; though the Lord ſeems to caſt them out of his hand and out of his care, yet his Heart works towards them; if there be but, among a heap of Tares, a grain of Wheat, though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little, if there be but the Seed of God, there is Seminal Vertue in it, yet,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:133178:83"/>ſays God, ſhall not the leaſt grain fall upon the Earth: And the reaſon of Gods kindneſs in general is this, the enmity of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is againſt the grains, and the kindneſs and grace of God doth extend unto the leaſt grain; and therefore notwithſtanding the enmity of Hell, and of thoſe that are ſpirited by Hell, yet God hath ſaid, <hi>Lo, I will command and I will ſift,</hi> he will command and he will ſecure, he will ſecure the leaſt grain, that it falls not to the Earth. Brethren, you that have attained to greater meaſures of grace, think not your ſelves unconcerned in this word, the time may come you may ſee little enough, and thoſe that have moſt grace, are many times leaſt ſenſible.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall proceed to what remains, and that is yet to give you <hi>a further account of the Lords
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:133178:83"/>kindneſs, and of the Lords gracious care of his little ones, in the moſt perilous and dangerous times:</hi> Temptations are high, perſecutions are high, corruptions are high, yet if there be but the leaſt grace, thy Soul ſhall not miſcarry. In the further proſecution of this Subject, I ſhall only commend to your ſerious conſideration, theſe four Scripture obſervations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And the firſt is this. Therefore <hi>the leaſt Chriſtian, that hath the leaſt grace, ſhall not eternally miſcarry and fall to the Earth, when the Chaff and Tares do:</hi> Becauſe that the Lord, in the manage of the diſpenſations of his providence, will ſo deal with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as he dealt with Chriſt, and let me tell you that Chriſt and the Spirit of Chriſt, are alſo conſenting to, and concerned in, this reſolve. What a poor thing was it, that all the Roman Empire, and all the ſtate of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Jews, ſhould be concerned againſt a Carpenters Son, and yet they could not carry it he, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles out only a few Fiſher-men for his Companions, and yet they were not able, with all their intereſt, and with all their learning, to bring any thing to any period againſt their attempts. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the 53 <hi>Chap.</hi> of his prophecy, gives us an account of the firſt ſenſe of the People
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:133178:84"/>of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was the grand practical principle of theirs, and the Romans reſolve againſt him the 2 verſe: <hi>For he ſhall grow up as a tender plant, as a root out of a dry ground, he hath no form nor comelineſs, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him</hi> Is this the Meſſiah (as if they ſhould ſay) which is the matter of all the promiſes and prophecies, of the Old Teſtament? No this is not he; is not this, ſay they (when he did appear) the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters Son, the poor Child of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Carpenter, whoſe Father and Mother is with us? We know him well enough, and yet notwithſtanding all the meanneſs of his deſcent and the unlikely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his producing his deſigned ſucceſs in the World, yet he carries on all before him; whilſt he was living the Phariſees themſelves and the Scribes were afraid of him: <hi>If we let this man alone,</hi> ſay they, <hi>the World will run after him, and the</hi> Romans <hi>will come, and take away our Nation from us.</hi> Such a ſecret ſenſe they had of the ſucceſs, and a ſecret power that did begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and would further appear in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his miniſtry. Now, my friends, we grow up all as roots out of dry ground. Take a willow, and plant it upon the top of a mountain, which is a dry ſandy ground,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:133178:84"/>it is not like to grow there; ſo take a Chriſtian that hath but a little light, and but a little grace, plant him in a wicked fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, amongſt a company of wicked Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, you will think he is not likely to make any thing of his Chriſtianity there: Father is againſt him, Mother againſt him, Brethren againſt him, every mans hand is againſt the new Profeſſor, and yet he grows. And this Root that is growing out of a dry ground hath many a pluck, <hi>Satan</hi> gives a pluck at it, and the World gives a pluck at it, and yet the root continues in the ground, and this root that is thus planted in this dry ground, an unlikely place to produce any thing to any Spiritual or eternal purpoſe, goes on its way; why ſurely, my friends, this muſt needs diſcover a great reaſon why Chriſtians that are unlikely to be ſecured, unlikely to live, why they ſhould both live and be ſecured in their life; why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was ſo dealt withal. I ſhall give you two illuſtrations of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And the firſt is this: <hi>It is the general deſign of the Goſpel, that all things ſhould be ſo carryed on, and managed, that it might be to the advancement of free grace:</hi> To cut off, as the Apoſtle ſays, all occaſion of boaſting in our ſelves, for if we do conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:133178:85"/>what we have to boaſt of, alas, you that are ſtrong you were as weak as others, you that have your Hearts, as you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend now, full of grace, they were once as empty as others, and you that are now, as it were, in full communion and fellow ſhip with God, you once ſtood at an equal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with others, what have you to boaſt of? When the Lord would cut off all occaſion of boaſting from the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſays he, <hi>thy Father was an Ammorite, and thy Mother an Hitite, and thy Birth and Nativity were of the Land of</hi> Canaan, here I pray conſider in the ſequel of this diſcourſe of his, in the 16 of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the general State of every profeſſor from firſt to laſt, <hi>I found thee in thy Blood,</hi> ſays he, <hi>caſt out to the loathing of thy Perſon.</hi> What could be preſaged or preſumed upon as to this but only death, nothing but miſery and ruin could atend thee, I found thee in thy Blood, as a Child new born, caſt out into the open Field, expoſed unto the varieties of Weather, ſays God, ſo I found thee. <hi>Thy Father was an Ammorite and thy Mother an Hitite;</hi> well what then? ſee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God v. 8, <hi>when I paſſed by thee and looked upon thee, behold thy time was a time of love:</hi> As if the Lord ſhould ſay, and would have us to underſtand, that all his dealings with us ſhould
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:133178:85"/>be acknowledged by us to be the Iſſues of his free grace, afterwards you ſhall find how the Lord deckt her with Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and clothed her with broidered work, and ſhod her with badgers Skins, and girded her about with fine linnen from the 10 <hi>verſe,</hi> and ſo on. He goes on to diſcover her beauty and yet ſhe was found in her bloud caſt out to the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her perſon, and yet the Lord made her ſo beautiful and ſo comely that there was none to be compared to her, and the ſame of her beauty went forth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Earth. Truly, Chriſtians, the Lord hath diſcovered the ſame thing to be his deſign in the new Teſtament, as the Apoſtle ſaies in his Epiſtle to the Romans, he concludes them all under ſin; all Children of wrath, all in their blood, all polluted and what is the deſign? <hi>that no fleſh,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>may glory in his ſight.</hi> So that you ſee here, Chriſtians, that the Lords deſign is to make us conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſt and he will take care of us &amp; about us in our low condition, and this is his deſign that neither thoſe that are weak Chriſtians, nor thoſe that are ſtrong Chriſtians, ſhould aſcribe any thing to themſelves but that we ſhould cry, grace, grace, to every little work of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:133178:86"/>grace and to the ſmalleſt gifts of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord will take care of the meaneſt grace, becauſe he will deal by them as he dealt by his own Son that ſo their hearts may be more united unto Chriſt,</hi> That their hearts may be more encouraged under all their Spiritual diſcouragements to fall in with Chriſt. Why thou ſayeſt alas, I am a dry Tree, and it may be thou haſt been ſo theſe many years, and thou cryeſt out, O this wilderneſs heart of mine! O this barren heart of mine; I can ſee nothing at all in it, but every temptation runs me down, every body tramples upon me. Why it was ſo with Chriſt, as to his worldly Adverſaries, though not ſo as to his Spiritual Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but, my friends, here lay the deſign of God concerning you, that you alſo may be encouraged to come to Chriſt who was lookt upon as the leaſt grain in all Gods. Sieve, <hi>He grew,</hi> as I obſerved, <hi>as a root out of a dry ground,</hi> he was deſpiſed of the nations, and he was abhorred of the people, that is, as he was conſidered under the notion of a Meſſiah or Mediator: ſo I ſay the Lord Chriſt was deſpiſed. Well it may be ſo are you deſpiſed and diſcouraged, and the Lord hath a good end in permiſſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, and in preſent poſitive provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences about your littleneſs, and about your
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:133178:86"/>deſpiſedneſs; the Lord hath a good end in it, and what is the end of the Lord but to bring you nearer unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Why, Chriſtians, let me tell you, the meaneſt of you may ſay in ſome ſenſe, Lord, thou wert even as we are the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed of the nations, thou waſt abhorred of the people even as we are, thou wert temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as we are. And I will but only add one thing more, that God expoſed his Son to greater ſervitude then ever he did, or will, or can, expoſe any Chriſtian to, than what Chriſt himſelf was expoſed to; There is not a meaner ſervice, though honourable in its ſelf, there is not a meaner condition that any Chriſtian can be expoſed to: So that you may obſerve from hence the meaning of that expreſſion that <hi>he learned obedience,</hi> that is, he learned a Goſpel carriage <hi>by the things that he ſuffered,</hi> as you have it in the 5 <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. A Goſpel carriage, how, and to whom? truly, friends, a Goſpel carriage to the meaneſt and pooreſt of Goſpel Chriſtians. This is the advantage of all that I have ſaid in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of this, that the meaneſt Chriſtian may look upon Chriſt as once in a meaner condition than himſelf; and yet he may look upon Chriſt, notwithſtanding the meanneſs of his condition as to externals,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:133178:87"/>as under a preſent ſenſe and an overrule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engagment to look after and alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them that are ſo mean.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond reaſon why the Lord will not ſuffer the leaſt grain, or the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that hath the leaſt grace, to miſcarry, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all its ſhakings and ſiftings, though in the ſieve of the Nations, is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath taken, under both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a peculiar and primary cognizance of thoſe that are leaſt in grace:</hi> there is none that lie nearer the Heart and Boſom of God and Chriſt, then thoſe that are new born. I ſhall open it in general, and then illuſtrate it in two particulars. In general, I will only turn you to one paſſage in the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in the 40. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> There you have the Lord declaring his ſenſe, and Prophecying what ſhould be his Sons carriage to his People, <hi>he ſhall feed his flock like a Shepherd.</hi> Ay, but there are Lambs, and thoſe that are new faln Lambs, that are weak, that cannot go, that want che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, that they are falne in a ſtormy day, that is, as I conceive, Chriſtians begotten under Perſecution for Chriſtianity's ſake, young ones not in reſpect of their natural but their Spiritual Birth, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them. The flocks are better able to bear the buſle of the wind and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:133178:87"/>weather and ſtormes, but what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the lambs? <hi>Why,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>he ſhall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his Boſome, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with young,</hi> you ſhall find the like care expreſſed by our Lord after his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>John</hi> 21.15. <hi>v.</hi> and when they had dined Jeſus ſaid to <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> Simon <hi>Son of</hi> Jonas <hi>loveſt thou me more then theſe? He ſaith unto him, yea Lord thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> he doth not ſay if thou loveſt me, then go and die for me, then go and renounce thy forſwearing of me, he doth not ſay if thou loveſt me go and expoſe thy ſelf to all hazzards for my names ſake, but the firſt thing that he fixeth upon as the manifeſtation of his love to him is, <hi>the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his lambs:</hi> As if the meaneſt and the weakeſt were more the care of Chriſt, and nearer the heart of Chriſt, than the ſheep, which afterwards he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to feed; if thou loveſt me, <hi>feed my lambs.</hi> O Chriſtians, the great care and the great proviſion that is made in both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the great injunctions that are laid upon thoſe that are concerned in the adminiſtration of both Teſtaments, is, to look after the meaneſt Chriſtians, which muſt needs diſcover this great truth, that the meaneſt Chriſtian, that is a Chriſtian indeed, ſhall not miſcarry, but I ſhall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:133178:88"/>open this further to you in two branches</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the leaſt grace in the leaſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is the product of the greateſt grace that works in the Bleſſed Trinity.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the leaſt Chriſtian, but the great and infinite grace of the Bleſſed Trinity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to the producing of it. This I would only illuſtrate to you by a paſſage of our Lord in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 31. where he compares the Kingdom of Heaven to a grain of muſtard ſeed, why what is the Kingdom of Heaven but the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, according to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſels of God, that are paſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? <hi>Now,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is as a grain of muſtard ſeed.</hi> Why but Lord, might they ſay, here is a grain that hath brought forth and ſpread abundantly, this is like the Kingdom of Heaven indeed; ay but ſaies he, the little grain though it be the leaſt of all grains, is a fit ſimilitude and compariſon for the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; <hi>To what ſhall I liken the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> The Kingdom of Heaven, ſaies he, <hi>is like a grain of muſtardſeed, which a man took and ſowed in his field:</hi> So that there is the whole reſemblance of the Kingdom of Heaven, even in a little grain, as ſoon as ever it is ſown, as much as when it is in its greateſt flouriſh, after its full growth, there is a real and a comprehenſive reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:133178:88"/>of it in the leaſt ſeed of grace, that is ſown in thy heart, there is the Grace of the Kingdom manifeſted in thee; the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Kingdom is manifeſted in thee; The offices of all perſons concerned in the Kingdom, they are all manifeſted in thee, Jeſus Chriſts mediation, and the Spirits Sanctification, and the Fathers Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theſe are all manifeſted upon the leaſt work of grace that is wrought in thee: I tell you, there is a ſubſtantial manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the bleſſedneſſes of the Kingdom of Heaven, in the leaſt work of grace that is wrought upon any Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The leaſt work of grace, upon the Heart of the leaſt Chriſtian, is a manifeſtation, not only of the Kingdom of Heaven, but a real demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Kingdom of Glory.</hi> A demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>á priori,</hi> as they call it, a demonſtration of that which is antecedent, or anantecedent demonſtration, of the Kingdom of Glory, as well as the greateſt flouriſhes of grace. I pray, Chriſtians, conſider, you that are young in grace, you have a demonſtration in you, an antecedent demonſtration of the Kingdom of Glory, I pray what is the Kingdom of Glory, but the flouriſh of that love, that I have now wrought in me, in the Kingdom of grace? It is the increaſe of my likeneſs to God, and to Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven, that is now begun in me, this
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:133178:89"/>is the Kingdom of Glory. Now this little work of grace is an antecedent demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of an incomprehenſible weight of Glory that is to be put upon the People of God, when they come in Heaven, and this you may ſee evidenced in the parable, that I laſt mentioned, and in the other parables, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth make uſe of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Third Propoſition is this, <hi>That the greateſt and dreadfulleſt threatnings are denounced againſt diſcouraging carriages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that have leaſt grace, as well as towards thoſe that have greateſt:</hi> Nay let me alſo tell you this, that although they themſelves be under the tokens of Gods diſpleaſure, yet their Relation to God doth heightenthem, as aggravations of their enemies carriage towards them. I find not a greater threatning ever came out of the mouth of Chriſt Jeſus, when he was on Earth, then this, <hi>It were better,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>for that man that he had a Milſtone hanged about his neck, and he caſt into the midſt of the Sea, then he ſhould offend one of theſe little ones that believeth on me,</hi> he ſpeaks not of little ones as to nature, but of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones as to grace. The deſign of the Jews was to lay ſtumbling blocks before the little ones, that is, thoſe that had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:133178:89"/>love to Chriſt, thoſe that had a little Faith on Chriſt, thoſe whoſe hearts were engaged by that little fire of grace that was in them, to follow the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Says Chriſt, <hi>If any man doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend one of theſe little ones, it were better for him that a Milſtone were hanged about his neck, and he caſt into the midſt of the Sea.</hi> But I ſhall open this likewiſe in theſe two branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Gods ſevereſt execution of threatnings takes its riſe from the adverſaries carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the leaſt of thoſe that belong to him:</hi> As for inſtance, you know God threatned that he would have perpetual War with <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and why with <hi>Ameleck</hi> more then with <hi>Moab,</hi> or with <hi>Edom,</hi> or the other Nations that gave diſturbance to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? you ſhall find the reaſon to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they watched their opportunity, and ſmote the hinmoſt of the People; they did not march upon the front of the People, but they watched their advantage, and they ſmote the hinmoſt, and feebleſt of the People, <hi>therefore,</hi> ſays God, <hi>I will have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual War with</hi> Amaleck: and this lay as it were reſerved in the Boſom of God, till the firſt King that ever appeared upon the Throne of <hi>Iſrael. Saul</hi> was not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rally his Forces and go againſt <hi>Egypt,</hi> that Old Enemy, that Old Oppreſſor, nor
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:133178:90"/>againſt <hi>Moab,</hi> and thoſe that inveigled them, and inticed them in the matter of <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> but <hi>go,</hi> ſays God to Saul, <hi>and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroy</hi> Amalek, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. <hi>from off the face of the Earth.</hi> And <hi>Saul</hi> he did ſpare none but poor King <hi>Agag,</hi> and God was ſo incenſed againſt him, that he ſent <hi>Samuel</hi> his Prophet to him, to tell him, that God had rent the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from him, at the 28. <hi>v.</hi> becauſe he did not execute the fierceneſs of his wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> for ſmiting the hindmoſt of the People, and thoſe that were feeble amongſt them, as they came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And truly, Friends, this is the deſign, and hath been all along the deſign of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual adverſaries, they ſeldom march up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Front, but in the Spirit of <hi>Amalek,</hi> they wait for their advantage upon thoſe that are weak and feeble: And for my part I do think, that this will be one of the greateſt aggravations of the ſin of the Devils, that they have Tempted the little ones that have followed Jeſus Chriſt. I pray take notice of another paſſage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the poor and weak condition, the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in, the time of <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah;</hi> you ſhall find in that Prophecy that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> came upon them, and makes a ſquander among the People, and here
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:133178:90"/>were two or three, and there was another two or three, or it may be more in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that skulkt away, from his force and cruelty, into by ways and by places, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſhift for themſelves, and ſave their lives. I pray do but obſerve now how the Lord comes upon <hi>Edom,</hi> that was the Off-ſpring of <hi>Eſau, Jacobs</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the 10. <hi>v.</hi> of that prophecy, <hi>for thy violence againſt thy Brother</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſhame hath covered thee, and thou ſhalt be cut off for ever.</hi> Lord, might <hi>Edom</hi> ſay, didſt not thou ſay, thou wouldſt utterly deſtroy this People from the Earth? and I will hiſs for the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and, Lord, haſt thou not ſaid that <hi>Aſſyria</hi> is the rod of thine anger in thy hand? well, my Friends, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that could be objected in a way of reaſon, ſee how God treats with <hi>Edom, v.</hi> 1.4. <hi>neither ſhouldſt thou have ſtood in the croſs way, to cut off thoſe of his that did eſcape, &amp;c.</hi> This I only produce to diſcover to you the ſeverity of Gods threatning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe, that offer diſturbance and diſcouragement to his People in their weakeſt capacities and conditions: The like you may obſerve in the Revelations, and in the other paſſages of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I will not any further proceed upon that, ſo that you ſee I have opened a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:133178:91"/>further reaſon of the Lords ſpecial care, and tender regard, that he hath over his own People.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The greateſt promiſes lay hold upon thoſe that are in the meaneſt condition, upon thoſe that are in the pooreſt, weakeſt, unlikelieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</hi> Be not diſcouraged, Chriſtian, at the unlikelineſs that is upon thy Soul, as to the grouth of grace, though your grace be little, and your diſcouragements great, yet let me tell you, there are greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the word, proportionally conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, made to you, than to others. I pray obſerve what the Pſalmiſt ſay's, in the 72. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16. <hi>v. There ſhall be a handful of Corn in the Earth, upon the top of the Mountain, the fruit thereof ſhall ſhake like</hi> Lebanon, <hi>and they of the City ſhall flouriſh like the Graſs of the Earth,</hi> They are, in a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſhall flouriſh like the Graſs of the Earth; thoſe that proſper in ſeculars or in temporals, they ſhall not loſe their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but ſhall flouriſh like the Graſs of the Earth, but, ſays he, there ſhall be at that time, when theſe things ſhall be, <hi>there ſhall be a People that ſhall be caſt into the World, as a handful of Corn that is caſt upon the top of the Mountain;</hi> alas, what can you expect from a handful of Corn, that is caſt upon the top of a mountain, but that it
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:133178:91"/>ſhould be withered and dried up? why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there want Earth and Soil to nouriſh it, and the ſpirit of the Earth to maintain it; therefore it cannot be expected, that it ſhould come to any maturity. Yet, ſays the Lord, when they of the City ſhall flouriſh like the Graſs, <hi>then the handful of Corn that is upon the top of the Mountain,</hi> (that is expoſed to wind and weather) <hi>the fruit thereof ſhall ſhake like</hi> Lebanon, <hi>they ſhall grow like the Cedars in</hi> Lebanon; ſo that you ſee, my Friends, thoſe that are unlikely, thoſe that are meaneſt, that are but <hi>as a handful of Corn caſt upon the Mountains,</hi> yet I tell you, you are under as great a promiſe, as any under their greateſt external flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, they of the City ſhall flouriſh, as the Graſs of the Earth, but thoſe that are caſt upon the Mountain ſhall ſhake like <hi>Lebanon.</hi>

                  <hi>to thoſe that are leaſt,</hi> they are grains, but they are the leaſt grain; my
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:133178:92"/>meaning plainly is this, and I think it is the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt; thoſe that have leaſt grace, and thoſe that have leaſt gifts, &amp; thoſe that have done leaſt for God, and thoſe that have enjoyed leaſt of God, thoſe that have obſerved leaſt of Gods goings in his Sanctuary, that have experienced leaſt of Gods workings upon their Spirits; my deſign, Chriſtians, is principally upon you and therfore I ſhall ſay three or four things particularly to you, and the firſt is this, <hi>be not diſcouraged at your littleneſs of grace, if there be but truth of grace:</hi> There were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny when the ſecond Temple was built, and they ſaw it did not amount to the glory of the firſt Temple, they fell a weeping, and were greatly diſcouraged, and God was fain to raiſe them up a Prophet on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to bear up their ſpirits. O there was not that Gold, there was not that outward Glory and Splendor, that there was upon the firſt Temple that was deſtroyed! and God raiſed them up a Prophet, and what ſays the Prophet to them, ſays he, You ſaw the Glory of the former Temple, and I tell you, ſays he, <hi>that the Glory of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Temple ſhall be greater than the Glory of the former:</hi> They were diſcouraged at the plainneſs, and meanneſs of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of the furniture, and adorning of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:133178:92"/>the Temple; nay, ſays God, if that be the thing, do not trouble your ſelves about it. So I ſay, my Friends, you may take an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of others Hearts, and compare others Hearts with yours, and you fall a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, and diſcouragement ſeizes upon you, nay but let me ſay to you, in the name of the Lord, if there be but a little grace, be not diſcouraged at the littleneſs of it; you have reaſon to be humbled, that it is no more, that is very true, but yet you have no reaſon to be diſcouraged, becauſe there is a little, and the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to tell you, that it lay in his power, and within the reach of his grace, to make the glory of that little grace, that is in your Heart, far exceed the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that great deal, that you obſerve to break forth in the Hearts of others, and therefore be not diſcouraged. I ſhall urge this under theſe two conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thou ſeeſt it may be what is in thy heart, but thou doeſt not know what is in Chriſts hand for thy heart.</hi> Thou ſeeſt what comes out of Chriſts hand to thy heart, but thou doeſt not ſee what remains in Chriſts hand for thee, therefore be not diſcouraged becauſe it is little. I pray do but obſerve a paſſage in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.8. <hi>In that day ſhall the Lord defend the inhabitants
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:133178:93"/>of</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>And he that is feeble among them</hi> (That is he that hath little Courage, little ſpirit, little ſtrength; the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies he that is ſo feeble that he is faln a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them faln among the Croud, by reaſon of his feebleneſs, he that is feeble among them,) <hi>At that day, ſhall be as</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>and the houſe of</hi> David <hi>ſhall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before them.</hi> Now, Chriſtian, I pray what is the diſcouragement that lieth upon thee? thou ſayeſt thou art feeble and thou art weak and thou art poor &amp; thou art empty, thy heart is empty, &amp; thy head empty, and thy affections empty, thy prayers are empty, &amp; thy converſation emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; all this is true &amp; God knows it is true &amp; whence comes all this? O thou art fallen in the ſtreets by reaſon of the feebleneſs of thy grace, and the weakneſs that doth attend thy duties, thou canſt hardly ſet a ſtep but thou falleſt, thou goeſt ſtumbling and ſtambling on to Heaven, and thou haſt not ſtrength enough ſcarce to go through any diſcouragement: Well, friend, though it be thus with thee, yet conſider here is the word of the Lord for thy encouragement, <hi>The feeble amongſt them ſhall be as</hi> David. And I pray in whoſe hand is the cuſtody or keeping of the Bleſſing that is wrapt up in this promiſe? Is it not in the hand of Chriſt? All this courage and all this ſtrength
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:133178:93"/>and all theſe parts and all this grace that muſt make thee like <hi>David,</hi> A man after Gods own heart to fulfil actually all his will, all this is in the hands of Chriſt: <hi>And the feeble ſhall be as</hi> David. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray, Sirs, though you ſee but little in your own hearts, yet be not diſcouraged, you do not ſee all that is in the heart and hand of Chriſt for you. That is the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You complain of your feebleneſs and littleneſs; alas, you are as Corn that is dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled up, as we ſay: the leaſt of grains. Ay but conſider, <hi>there is the ſeminal vertue of more in you:</hi> That little grace that is in you hath a ſeminal vertue in it, <hi>God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>who are his:</hi> Thoſe that are born of God, that have the ſeed of God in them <hi>God</hi> knows them. So that though thou doeſt not know, by reaſon of thy littleneſs, what thou art, yet God knows notwithſtanding thy littleneſs what thou art; he knows that there is a ſeed of grace in thee, and therefore I ſay be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Is it ſo that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will look after his little ones and will not ſuffer the leaſt grain to fall upon the Earth. <hi>Then be you putting forth a little though it be but a little.</hi> Thou complaineſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:133178:94"/>thou art but little; truly I am affraid that many mens complaints are attended with as much formality as ever the Scribes and Phariſees Religion was. Now I ſay if it be but <hi>a little,</hi> thou haſt reaſon the more to be putting forth <hi>that little:</hi> And let me tell you Jeſus Chriſt doth expect that you ſhould be putting forth your little, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that you are wheat indeed, that you are Chriſtians indeed, And though you cannot do ſo much as another doth, yet I beſeech you conſider, if you be but a grain you may do more than others, that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind you, that have not the leaſt grain of grace wrought in them, you may do more than they do. I will urge this with two conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is this. <hi>A little improvement made by us goeth a great way with God;</hi> A little Goſpel improvement made of a little on Earth goes a great way in Heaven: And let me tell you this alſo further, that there are no bounds that can poſſibly be ſuppoſed to be preſcribed to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and to the reward, of the improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a little grace. You know not, my friends, but a weak one may become a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a feeble one may be multiplyed, by the Bleſſing of God; into many Nations; you know not how God may bleſs a little
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:133178:94"/>improvement. Therefore my exhortation to you is, to ſtir up your ſelves to be putting forth ſomething; if you have but a little faith let it appear that you have a little; and if you haue but a little love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to his perſon and Offices, let that little appear, Sirs: and though it do appear but little on earth yet, let me tell you, it will go a great way in Heaven. You may obſerve this, by that poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had but one poor mite to caſt into the treaſury; and Jeſus Chriſt ſat at the door obſerving how rich men came, and caſt into the treaſury of the Houſe of the Lord a great deal, and this poor Woman comes, that had but one mite, &amp; ſhe caſt in all that ſhe had. I pray obſerve how far this goes with Chriſt; Chriſt could not forbear but calls his diſciples to him &amp; ſaith, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you this Woman hath caſt in more than they all.</hi> Why, my friends, if you have but a mite, caſt it in, though you can but ſigh or groan, though you can do but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet do a little for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, do a little for him in your hearts, do a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for him in your families amongſt yours Children and Servants: It may be you have but little to be doing withal, I pray be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething with your little: It is for the Lord Chriſt, you know not how far in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:133178:95"/>Heaven a little that is done on Earth may go.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hath the Lord taken ſuch cae to preſerve his little ones, though they be the leaſt grains, and that, in all the Commonti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Revolutions of affairs, when God is ſifting his people in the ſieve of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he knows do hate them wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 chunk">
                     <desc>…</desc>
                  </gap> perfect hatred? then methinks, <hi>This ſhould ſpeak encouragement unto the little ones not only to put forth a little for Chriſt, but this alſo ſhould lay an engagment upon them to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuffer any thing, rather than to part with the care and protection of God and Chriſt.</hi> You have a little, Sirs, well here ſtands the caſe; will you part with and for go that God and that Chriſt, that have the care and the charge of your little grace, or will you ſtick to him? Methings you ſhould be willing to ſuffer a little for Chriſt, rather than to part with that great ſecurity that is betruſted with Chriſt for you. The apoſtle had but little of the world, yet he met with great ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; it may be you have but little grace in the world, and God calls you to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſufferings, in compariſon with thoſe thut are truly and formally great ſufferings; Why now, Sirs, I pray be willing to part with ſomething for the ſake of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſuffer the loſs of ſomething. I do not ſpeak as to temporalls, but I ſpeak as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:133178:95"/>to thoſe things that your hearts are moſt addicted too ſuffer the loſs of ſomething: You ſee a little grace hath a deal of care; taken about it. I pray, Chriſtians, if there be any thing in you that is ſinful do you part with it, do not only ſuffer the loſs of a little, but ſuffer the loſs of your All that is offenſive to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſaid that, notwithſtanding all your ſufferings, he will look after that little grace that is in you.</p>

And men of great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, that think their heads are full, and I could wiſh their Hearts were fuller than their heads, there are many that have full heads, but God knows have very empty Hearts, but I ſay, Chriſtians, I beſeech you in the Lord, and by the Lord, that you would carry it as becomes you, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that are little, thoſe that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:133178:96"/>have but a little grace, do what in you ly's to increaſe that little, to cheriſh that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. I ſhould urge this with diverſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, I will only ſay this, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the encreaſe of their little will be alſo your encreaſe, their bleſſing will be your bleſſing, as you are members of the whole; It may be you have a great deal of grace, but let me tell you, ſuppoſe you have, God may make them very uſeful to you, and more uſeful than thoſe that have more grace were ever made to you: It may be there are two Chriſtians come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, men that do pretend to a great deal of grace, they fall into diſcourſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and what is the ſubject of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe? alas it may be, it is nothing that doth concern the mutual advance of grace in each other; but there comes a poor Chriſtian, that hath but little, and he falls of inquiring, O how ſhall I get more grace? and diſcovers an earneſtneſs and zeal of ſpirit after more grace; and many other things of this nature might be urged, I will but only add this: I pray, Chriſtians, you that have a great deal of grace, how came you by that great deal? was it not all by grace? did not other Chriſtians help you? did they diſcourage you? did they caſt ſtumbling blocks of iniquity before your
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:133178:96"/>face? did they receive you to doubtful diſputations? No, no, they were ready to cheriſh and encourage you, and ſo God gave the encreaſe. But this is that that I would have you to take along with you, that their little may be better than your great deal, if they improve their little, better then you do your great deal, and it may be true in this ſenſe, that they that have leaſt may have moſt, and they that are laſt may come to be firſt: and therefore, Chriſtians, you that think you have a great deal, ſee that you carry it as becomes you, to thoſe that have but little.</p>

Suppoſe, <hi>that the Lord ſhould now begin this ſifting work among you, I pray what promiſe have you to ſecure you?</hi> For ought I know, you may be ſifted out of the ſieve, the Tempeſt may come, and blow you with the Chaff into unquencheable fire: therefore, I beſeech you, conſider, there are ten thouſand times ten thouſand that have been baptized in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghoſt, that are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghoſt, and for ought I know this
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:133178:97"/>may be your caſe ere long, if you do not look after a little grace, to get it in due time. I pray, Sirs, conſider with your ſelves, what ſecurity you have, in caſe there ſhould be ſuch a diſpenſation, as is here threatned? that God ſhould ſift you, and it may be Satan may have liberty to raiſe the wind, whilſt God is ſifting in the ſieve of the Nations, what will become of the Chaff? Chriſt tells you, that he will come, ay, he will come, but it is in another ſenſe to you, <hi>he will come, and will throughly purge his floor with his Fann, and the Wheat he will gather into his garner, but the Chaff ſhall be burned with unquencheable fire.</hi> I pray, Sirs, do but conſider this one thing, is it not better for you to have a promiſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity now, than to defer it, upon hopes, that you may have it hereafter? the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe reaches to the leaſt of the grains, and no further; and I have no commiſſion to ſay any further to you, by way of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But then,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it ſo that there is ſuch a promiſe made to the leaſt grain, why, <hi>let me tell you, the promiſe of ſecurity, lay's open to you:</hi> though for the preſent, as you are ſinners, and while you are ſo, I cannot ſay that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe doth reach you. Yet notwithſtanding you are ſo, I may tell you the promiſe is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:133178:97"/>open to you, and let me further tell you, that the Heart of the Trinity, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the promiſe, and doth ſtand open to receive you: What think you of this, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? the promiſes of Sanctification are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, the promiſes of Salvation by grace are open to you. Though I cannot ſay, that to day thou art within the reach of the promiſes, yet if I could ſay that, before to morrow, thou haſt received grace, though but as a grain of muſtard ſeed; to morrow I could ſay, and ſay it in the name of the Lord, come what will come, God and Chriſt will look after this Soul. Is it not better for you then to day, whilſt it is called to day, to open your Hearts for Chriſt, and for the Spirit of Chriſt, and to get a little grace, though never ſo little, to day whilſt it is called to day; O Sinners! get a little grace, and be content to begin with a little: It is a little grace that will bring you within the reach of the promiſe. Do not ſay within your ſelves, then belike you think, we have no grace at all; why truly, if you be ſinners, I ſay you have not grace, not ſo much as a grain of muſtard ſeed, and I ſay, you are not yet within the reach of the promiſe; but I ſay if you get but a little grace, though never ſo little, that you may but be truly called a grain,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:133178:98"/>then I may ſee, though it be never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet the greateſt promiſes of protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are made to you, and you are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that are concerned in this promiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing that I would ſay to you that are no Grains, that have no grace at all, is this, <hi>I pray do but conſider with your ſelves when God, and Chriſt, and the Spirit come to paſs judgment and to give in evidence againſt you, what will you be able to anſwer?</hi> What will you ſay that grace was never offered to you? I muſt be forced to appear, and all the Miniſters that ever you have heard, and that have tendered the grace of Jeſus Chriſt, and Chriſt with all his fulneſs to you; all our Sermons and we, ſhall be brought in as evidences againſt you. Can you bear this? You that have heard us with delight, and have ſeemed to take pleaſure in what we have ſpoken and preached to you; what think you now to have us; one after another with all the Sermons that have been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your hearing, to be brought in as an evidence againſt you? And not only ſo but for God to come in againſt you, and ſay I offered you grace; and for Chriſt to ſay I offered you my blood; and the Spirit to ſay I ſtrove with you to work a work o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:133178:98"/>this is that my Soul longs after that I might perſwade every ſinner to become a ſaint, &amp; thatevery one that hath gotten a littlegrace, might make it his buſineſs to get more grace; For, ſinners, you can never have grace too ſoon, and, Saints, you can never have grace too much. I ſhall only urge all that I have ſaid with theſe 2 things.</p>
               <p>Firſt. <hi>If, ſinners, you will now come in and cloſe with Chriſt to day, while it is called to day,</hi> (Be you young or old I value it not, be you what you will be, whatſoever your condition be,) <hi>As ſoon as ever you come in, and get the leaſt grace, all the Trinity that is concerned in the promiſe will, according to their reſpective Relations, purſue the deſign and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of the promiſe upon you and for you, in all the ſucceeding circumſtances of your lives.</hi> Why is not this a thing that is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? It may be a wicked man may make a promiſe to thee, thou art his Child and he a wicked Father, if thou wilt not do ſo and ſo, he will not do this and that for thee: Why I pray now, is it not better for you to have the promiſe of one God for good, and to be in the reach of one of the promiſes of the bleſſed Trinity, than to be incompaſſed and invironed with all the promiſes of them that are enemies to God, and alſo to you for Gods ſake. Here now
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:133178:99"/>is a promiſe, yet ſhall not the leaſt Grain fall to the Earth when God ſifts, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I pray ballance this with all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Word when God comes a ſifting either by Temptation or Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or afflictions; when God comes a ſifting, I pray who can keep you in the Sieve? Who can keep you out of Hell? can all your rich friends and great friends, can all the powers of the World, keep you out of everlaſting burnings? No, It is only God can do it, yet ſhall not the leaſt Grain fall upon the Earth. For my part I think that one promiſe made by the Bleſſed God is better then to have a thouſand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes (though they were in a capacity to fulfil them) made by the greateſt Powers in the the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The laſt thing that I ſhall leave upon you is this, <hi>That the ſooner you cloſe with Chriſt the ſooner you will be ſafe;</hi> The ſooner you get grace the ſooner you will have the ſecurity of grace. Great are the diſtractions of the minds of men under various appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of approaching dangers; and, my friends; in a time and hour wherein the Lord ſays come, Chriſt ſays come and the Spirit ſays come and the Goſpel ſays come, and Miniſters ſay come, why do not you come? Sirs, to day, while it is called to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:133178:99"/>day. For my part, I think it is never too ſoon for a Soul to be ſafe for ever from everlaſting burnings, and therefore if you do believe the things that I have delivered, you that are Saints of a little attainment, carry it as becomes you; You that are Saints of a greater attainment carry it as becomes you; and you that have attained no grace at all carry it as becomes you. And this is that that becomes you, To come unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and be reſtleſs till the Lord make you one of his graines though never ſo little.</p>
